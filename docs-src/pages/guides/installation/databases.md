  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
  ```

2. **Configure PostgreSQL**: After installation, PostgreSQL should be up and running. By default, it creates a `postgres` user with administrative privileges. You may need to set a password for this user and configure access permissions as needed. Refer to the PostgreSQL documentation for detailed instructions on configuration.

3. **Connect to PostgreSQL**: Once PostgreSQL is installed and configured, you can connect to it using pgAdmin or command-line tools like `psql`. Use these tools to manage databases, create tables, and execute SQL queries.

## SQLite

1. **Download SQLite**: Visit the [SQLite Downloads](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) page and download the SQLite tools for Windows. You can choose between the precompiled binaries or the command-line shell.

2. **Install SQLite**: After downloading, extract the contents of the downloaded file to a directory of your choice. SQLite is a self-contained, serverless database engine, so there's no formal installation process required.

3. **Set up Environment Variables (Optional)**: If you plan to use SQLite from the command line frequently, you may want to add the directory containing the SQLite executable to your system's PATH environment variable. This will allow you to run SQLite commands from any directory in the command prompt.

### Linux

1. **Install SQLite**: SQLite is likely available in your Linux distribution's package repositories. Use your package manager to install SQLite. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3
```

2. **Verify Installation**: After installation, verify that SQLite is installed correctly by running the following command in the terminal:

```
sqlite3 --version
```

This command should display the installed version of SQLite.

3. **Start Using SQLite**: Once installed, you can start using SQLite from the command line by running the `sqlite3` command followed by the name of the database file you want to create or connect to. For example:

```
sqlite3 mydatabase.db
```

This command will open the SQLite command-line interface and create or connect to a database file named `mydatabase.db`.
