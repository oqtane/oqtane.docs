## Troubleshooting Upgrading Installations

Upgrading Oqtane to a newer version can sometimes lead to unexpected issues due to changes in dependencies, configurations, or other system requirements. This guide will help you resolve common problems encountered during the upgrade process.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Upgrade Failures After Running Migration Scripts

**Symptom:**  
The upgrade fails after running migration scripts, often with errors related to database schema or missing columns.

**Solution:**  
- Ensure that the database is fully backed up before attempting any upgrade.
- Double-check that the migration script was run on the correct database (development vs. production).
- If the migration fails, check for any specific error messages that can indicate missing or incompatible columns, and refer to the [Database Migrations Documentation](../migrations/database-migration.md) for resolving these issues.
- Manually apply any database updates if necessary using SQL scripts provided by Oqtane for your version.

### 2. Missing Files or References After Upgrade

**Symptom:**  
After upgrading Oqtane, some assets (such as images, CSS, or JavaScript files) are missing, or broken links are showing up.

**Solution:**  
- Clear the browser cache and refresh the page to ensure you're not seeing an outdated version.
- Verify that all the files in the `/assets` or `/wwwroot` directory have been copied correctly to the upgraded environment.
- Check the web.config or other settings files to ensure proper reference paths are maintained after the upgrade.
- Rebuild the project and deploy it again to ensure all assets are updated.

### 3. Compatibility Issues with Installed Modules

**Symptom:**  
Certain modules are not functioning as expected after the upgrade, or they may fail to load completely.

**Solution:**  
- Check the compatibility of each module with the Oqtane version you are upgrading to. Some modules may require updates or patches to work with newer Oqtane versions.
- If an issue persists, try uninstalling and reinstalling the module.
- If custom modules are used, ensure they are updated to the latest version or rebuilt to work with the current framework version.

### 4. SSL and Certificate Issues After Upgrade

**Symptom:**  
After upgrading Oqtane, you might experience SSL-related issues, such as errors related to expired or misconfigured certificates.

**Solution:**  
- Check the SSL certificate and verify that it is correctly configured in your environment, including the appropriate bindings in IIS or reverse proxies.
- Ensure that the correct certificates are loaded and that they are not expired. If expired, replace them and update the server configuration.
- If the site is running behind a proxy, ensure that it correctly passes the SSL header to the Oqtane application.

### 5. Performance Degradation Post-Upgrade

**Symptom:**  
After upgrading, the site performance is noticeably slower than before.

**Solution:**  
- Review the server's resource utilization, including CPU, RAM, and database performance, to ensure that the system is properly scaled for the new version.
- Check for any new logging or diagnostic features that may have been added in the latest Oqtane version, which could cause performance overhead.
- Review the upgrade notes for any new settings or configurations that could affect performance.
- Consider running performance diagnostics or using a profiler tool to identify bottlenecks.

### 6. Permissions or Access Control Issues

**Symptom:**  
After upgrading, certain user roles or permissions no longer function correctly, or users are unable to access certain parts of the site.

**Solution:**  
- Review the user roles and permissions settings in the Oqtane admin dashboard and make sure they are correctly configured for the new version.
- Check if any new role types or permission models were introduced in the latest upgrade and adapt your setup accordingly.
- Clear the cache and cookies to eliminate any residual permission issues from the browser session.

### 7. Dependency Errors During Upgrade

**Symptom:**  
You encounter errors regarding missing dependencies or version conflicts after the upgrade.

**Solution:**  
- Review the error logs to identify the specific dependencies causing issues.
- Ensure that your project's `packages.config` or `csproj` files are updated to reflect the new version of Oqtane and its dependencies.
- Run `dotnet restore` to restore missing packages and ensure compatibility.
- If necessary, update any third-party dependencies to be compatible with the new Oqtane version.

## General Troubleshooting Steps

If the specific issue you are facing is not listed here, try the following general troubleshooting steps:

1. **Clear Caches:**  
   Clear the browser cache and, if applicable, the server-side cache. You may need to restart the Oqtane application to ensure all updated settings are applied.

2. **Check Logs:**  
   Check the Oqtane application logs (`/logs` directory or via your web server's logging mechanism) for any error messages or warnings that could indicate problems during the upgrade process.

3. **Verify Configuration Files:**  
   Review all configuration files (such as `appsettings.json`, `web.config`, etc.) to ensure that all settings are correct and compatible with the upgraded Oqtane version.

4. **Rollback to Previous Version:**  
   If you cannot resolve the issue after the upgrade, you may consider rolling back to the previous Oqtane version. Be sure to have a full backup of the database and files before performing any rollback.
