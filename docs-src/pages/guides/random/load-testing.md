# Oqtane Framework - Load Testing

## Overview

Load testing is a crucial process in ensuring that your Oqtane application can handle expected user loads and perform optimally under stress. This guide provides an overview of load testing concepts, tools, and best practices specific to the Oqtane Framework.

## Why Load Test?

- **Performance Optimization**: Identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the application can scale with increased user load.
- **Stability**: Verify the application's stability under peak load conditions.
- **Reliability**: Confirm the application behaves reliably under varied conditions.

## Preparing for Load Testing

1. **Define Objectives**: Clearly state what you aim to achieve with load testing (e.g., max concurrent users, response times).
2. **Identify Key Scenarios**: Determine critical user actions and workflows to test (e.g., user login, data submission).
3. **Set Up Test Environment**: Ensure the test environment is as close to production as possible.

## Tools for Load Testing

### Apache JMeter

Apache JMeter is a popular open-source tool for performance and load testing. It supports various protocols and can simulate a large number of users.

- **Installation**: [Download JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi)
- **Documentation**: [JMeter User Manual](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/index.html)

### K6

K6 is a modern load testing tool built for developers. It offers an intuitive scripting interface and can integrate with CI/CD pipelines.

- **Installation**: [Get Started with K6](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)
- **Documentation**: [K6 Documentation](https://k6.io/docs/)

### Azure Load Testing

Azure Load Testing is a cloud-based load testing service that helps you identify performance bottlenecks. It integrates with Azure DevOps and other CI/CD tools.

## Best Practices

1. **Incremental Load Testing**: Start with a small number of users and gradually increase the load.
2. **Realistic Scenarios**: Use realistic user scenarios and workflows to get accurate results.
3. **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, throughput, and error rates.
4. **Analyze Results**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize your application based on the findings.
5. **Repeat Testing**: Continuously test and optimize to maintain performance as your application evolves.

## Sample JMeter Test Plan

Here's a basic example of setting up a load test in JMeter for an Oqtane application.

1. **Thread Group**: Define the number of users, ramp-up time, and loop count.
2. **HTTP Request Defaults**: Set the base URL for the Oqtane application.
3. **HTTP Request**: Add HTTP requests to simulate user actions (e.g., login, page navigation).
4. **Listeners**: Add listeners to gather and visualize test results (e.g., View Results Tree, Summary Report).

### Example Configuration

```xml
<ThreadGroup>
    <num_threads>100</num_threads>
    <ramp_time>60</ramp_time>
    <loop_count>10</loop_count>
</ThreadGroup>

<HTTPRequestDefaults>
    <Server>example.com</Server>
    <Protocol>https</Protocol>
</HTTPRequestDefaults>

<HTTPRequest>
    <Path>/login</Path>
    <Method>POST</Method>
</HTTPRequest>

<Listeners>
    <ViewResultsTree/>
    <SummaryReport/>
</Listeners>
```

## Conclusion

Load testing is essential to ensure the performance, scalability, stability, and reliability of your Oqtane application. By following the best practices and using appropriate tools, you can effectively load test your application and make necessary optimizations.
