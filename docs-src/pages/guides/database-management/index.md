# Database Management in Oqtane

Managing databases is a key part of working with Oqtane. This section covers everything from database best practices to migration and schema management. Below is an overview of the topics related to database management.

## Best Practices

Before diving into specific topics, it's important to be familiar with the best practices for managing databases in Oqtane. Refer to the [Best Practices](best-practices.md) guide for tips and recommendations on optimizing your database performance, security, and scalability.

## Database Setup and Installation

The installation of your chosen database system (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite) is crucial to ensure proper integration with Oqtane. For detailed instructions on setting up databases in various environments, refer to the [Database Installation Guide](../installation/databases.md), which provides step-by-step instructions for Windows and Linux platforms.

## Database Migrations

Database migrations in Oqtane allow you to evolve your database schema over time. If you're looking to perform or manage migrations, refer to the [Database Migrations](../migrations/database-migration.md) guide, which covers the process of migrating your database schema with each Oqtane release.

## Database Schema

Understanding the database schema is key to effective database management. The schema outlines the structure of the Oqtane database and is essential for customizations, troubleshooting, and performance optimizations. For detailed information on the Oqtane database schema, refer to the [Database Schema](database-schema.md) page.
