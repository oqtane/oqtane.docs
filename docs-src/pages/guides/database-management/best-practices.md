# Best Practices for Oqtane Development

This guide provides essential best practices for developing and maintaining an Oqtane-based application. By following these guidelines, you can ensure a more efficient, scalable, and secure development experience.

## 1. Organize Your Modules and Themes

### 1.1 Modular Design
Oqtane follows a modular architecture that enables you to extend its functionality by creating custom modules. When developing a new feature, it's recommended to:

- Keep features encapsulated in their own modules for easier maintenance.
- Follow the single responsibility principle: each module should focus on one area of functionality.

### 1.2 Consistent Theme Structure
Themes are essential for the visual look of your application. Follow these practices for managing themes:

- Use a consistent folder structure for assets (CSS, images, scripts).
- Separate core theme styles from custom modifications.
- Maintain responsive design practices to ensure compatibility across devices.

## 2. Secure Your Application

### 2.1 Use Secure Communication (SSL/TLS)
Always use SSL/TLS for your Oqtane application, especially for production environments. This ensures secure communication between clients and servers.

- Set up HTTPS for your web application.
- Use strong certificates and avoid using expired or self-signed certificates in production.

### 2.2 Secure User Authentication
Make sure to implement strong authentication practices:

- Use **two-factor authentication (2FA)** for administrative accounts.
- Regularly review and update user roles and permissions.
- Implement password strength policies and encourage users to update their passwords periodically.

### 2.3 Protect Sensitive Data
When dealing with sensitive data, ensure encryption and secure storage:

- Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
- Use secure storage solutions for user credentials, such as hashing algorithms for passwords.

## 3. Optimize Performance

### 3.1 Enable Caching
Enable caching where appropriate to improve the performance of your Oqtane site:

- Use the built-in caching mechanisms in Oqtane to store static content.
- Cache database queries and frequently accessed data to reduce load on the server.

### 3.2 Optimize Database Queries
Efficient database interactions are key to performance:

- Avoid complex queries that may impact performance.
- Regularly review the database schema to ensure it is optimized for the queries it serves.

### 3.3 Minimize Frontend Asset Size
Minimize the size of your frontend assets:

- Use minified versions of CSS and JavaScript files.
- Combine smaller CSS and JS files into single files to reduce HTTP requests.

## 4. Maintainable Code and Version Control

### 4.1 Use Version Control (Git)
Make sure your codebase is under version control, and follow these best practices:

- Create meaningful commit messages.
- Use feature branches for new development and keep the main branch stable.

### 4.2 Code Reviews
Before merging new features or changes, perform code reviews:

- Review for code quality, consistency, and adherence to Oqtane best practices.
- Test the code in different environments (development, staging, production).

## 5. Backup and Recovery Strategy

### 5.1 Regular Backups
Create regular backups for your Oqtane application, including:

- The application files and configuration.
- The database, especially before and after migrations.

### 5.2 Disaster Recovery Plan
Develop a disaster recovery plan that includes:

- Restoring the application from a backup.
- Handling server outages or data corruption.

## 6. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

### 6.1 Maintain Clear Documentation
Ensure that your code and processes are well-documented:

- Write clear documentation for custom modules, themes, and configuration settings.
- Update documentation regularly to reflect changes in functionality.

### 6.2 Share Knowledge with Your Team
Encourage team collaboration by:

- Sharing best practices and lessons learned with other developers.
- Maintaining an internal knowledge base for troubleshooting and solutions.
