# Oqtane API Documentation

## Colors and Icons

APIs can be daunting.
So we color-coded the menu to the left and added icons to make it easier for you to get around.

> [!NOTE]
> This is what the colors and icons in the TOC mean:
>
> * <span class="priority-web"></span> marks WebApi related things <br/>
> * <span class="priority-module"></span> marks Module related things <br/>
> * <span class="priority-theme"></span> marks Theme related to things <br/>
