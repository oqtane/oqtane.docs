# Oqtane Modules Developer Guide

> Oqtane Modules are extensions to add functionality to Oqtane system.
> This guide will help you get started with creating and using modules in Oqtane.

## What is a Module?

A module is a collection of files that add functionality to your system.
Modules include various Blazor components, CSS, JavaScript, images and more.

Since Oqtane is based on .net and Blazor, modules are built using Blazor components
and these are compiled into a DLL that is loaded by the Oqtane framework.

<!-- Here's an example:

<img src="./assets/oqtane-module-blazor-cms.org.jpg" class="full-width"> -->

<!-- In this example, the module controls:

1. Placement, size and styling of the logo - as well as how it changes in responsive scenarios.
2. The layout of the main menu, including the dropdowns.
3. The layout of the footer, including the social media links.
4. Font sizes and colors for various headings and normal text. -->

## Next Steps

> [!TIP]
> Before diving too deep into modules, make sure you understand the basics
> of [Extensions](xref:Dev.Extensions.Index).
