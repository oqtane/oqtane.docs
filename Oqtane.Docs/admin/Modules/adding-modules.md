# Adding Modules to a Page

In order to add a module to a page, simply open the control panel with the gear icon in the top right of a page and in the [module management feature](../control-panel/modules.md) there is the ability to select a new module from the options of:
* Admin Module: These are only available to people within the administrator role and there are many more default modules available to put onto your webpages\.
* Common Module: These are available both to administrators and to registered users to be able to use on pages that are specified as personilizable, meaning users can modify them as they see fit and they are unique and only viewable to registered users\.
* Developer Module: This feature is for placing a module creator onto a page which will provide you with useful pre-built structure and methods for writing code for your own modules\.

There are also features after selecting the module that you would like which are the:
* Title: Which is what will be displayed directly above the module as its title, if nothing is selected then the module's name will be put as the title\.
* Pane: Select which content pane you want the module to go inside of\. Panes are made visible with the [content editor](../SiteAdministrator/content-editor.md)\.
* Container: Select if you would like to have a title displayed above the module or not have one\.

### Adding One Module Across Multiple Pages

As noted earlier, modules are reusable pieces of functionality, and as such a single module can be inserted across multiple pages in a site\. Say, for example, you have an HTML module that holds a banner image and you want that banner image to also exist on five specific pages in your site\. Instead of adding a new module to all five of those pages and then inserting the same image, you can simply go into the Control Panel and then click Add an Existing Module to the page\. Adding already existing modules or sharing modules across multiple pages makes managing content that’s repeated much more efficient\. A content manager can then make edits in one module and instantly have those edits reflected across every page on which the module is shared\.
When a user hovers over the Modules menu item just below the Add New Module option is the Add Existing Module option\. This is the option you select when you want to add a module that already exists in the site to a different page\. When opting to use Add Existing Module, you must first select the page to copy a module from, which will populate the drop-down list of modules\. You can then follow the same process of adding a module to the page\.
