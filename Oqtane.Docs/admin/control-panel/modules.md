# Modules

Modules are a key feature of Oqtane as they allow for you to insert a massive variety of things into your web page. 
There are a wide variety of different that can be added to your page for a high level of customization. 
An administrator also has the ability to both download new modules onto the website or upload modules you have created to the marketplace, 
options which are found in the admin dashboard's [module management feature](../modules/index.md).

On the side control panel's module management section, you have the option to:
* Add A New Module: which will put a new module of your choosing onto the page which has the option of being a:
    * Admin Module: These are only available to people within the administrator role and there are many more default modules available to put onto your webpages.
    * Common Module: These are available both to administrators and to registered users to be able to use on pages that are specified as personilizable, meaning users can modify them as they see fit and they are unique and only viewable to registered users.
    * Developer Module: This feature is for placing a module creator onto a page which will provide you with useful pre-built structure and methods for writing code for your own modules.

* Add An Existing Module: Provides the ability to select modules that are already on other pages from your website.
    * Page: A list of other your other web pages where you can select a page on your site that has the module you would like.
    * Modules: A list of modules that are on the selected web page for you to select.

Directly below these options, when a module is selected, the module's description will appear in a purple box so you have a better understanding of what the module is for.
The other module options below this are:
* Title: Which is what will be displayed directly above the module as its title, if nothing is selected then the module's name will be put as the title.
* Pane: Select which content pane you want the module to go inside of. Panes are made visible with the [content editor](../site-administration/content-editor.md).
* Container: Select if you would like to have a title displayed above the module or not have one.
