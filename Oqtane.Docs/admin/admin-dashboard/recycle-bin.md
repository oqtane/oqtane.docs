# Recycle Bin

The Recycle Bin is a very useful and often overlooked feature of Oqtane, especially for new users. Oftentimes, a newly designated administrator for a site will simply assume that when something is deleted, it is gone. The next logical step would probably be to re-create the content that was just deleted. This could lead to frustrations with Oqtane. The Recycle Bin allows you to restore the content in most cases, which can save you time and frustration.
The Recycle Bin has two types of objects that can be restored, Pages and Modules. When you delete a page or a module, it will show up in the respective list. You can switch which list you're looking at by clicking the tabs at the top of the page. Clicking retore on one of the pages or modules will allow you to restore the selected item to their original place in your site.
The recycle bin feature has two options, restore and delete. With the restore button, the page or module is restoredm to its original location. The delete button permanently deletes the page from your website and you will cause it be removed permanently.
