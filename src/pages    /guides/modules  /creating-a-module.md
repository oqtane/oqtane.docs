# Creating a Module

Learn how to create custom modules for Oqtane to extend its functionality and add new features to your applications.

## Overview

Creating a module in Oqtane involves several steps, including setting up the project, defining module components, implementing functionality, and testing the module in different environments.

## Getting Started

To create a module for Oqtane, follow these steps:

1. Use the Oqtane Administration Dashboard > Module Management `Create Module` button to scaffold a new module project.
2. Navigate to the project which will be located in the root folder of the Oqtane.Framework folder.
