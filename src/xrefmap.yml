#
# This file contains a map of links we will often use,
# which can be referenced in the markdown files or in the oqtane source code.
# So it provides a short name, such as `Oqtane.Source`
# which can be linked as [](xref:Oqtane.Source)
#
# Some instructions:
# - Comments start with a `#`
# - Each link is a list item starting with `- uid: ...`
# - The `uid` is the short name, which can be used in markdown files
# - The `name` is the text which will be displayed in the markdown file
# - The `href` is the URL which will be linked to
