# Troubleshooting Login Issues

## Issue: Unable to log into a production website.

**Potential Cause:** An expired or improperly configured SSL certificate, or cookie issues.

### Resolution Steps:

1. **Check SSL Certificate:**
   - Verify if the SSL certificate for the website is expired. You can check this by clicking on the padlock icon in the browser's address bar, which will display certificate details.
   - If the certificate is expired, you will need to renew it through your certificate authority (CA).

2. **Validate SSL Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the SSL certificate is correctly installed and configured on the web server. Misconfigurations can lead to failed login attempts.
   - Use online tools (like SSL Labs) to test the SSL configuration and identify any issues.

3. **Update Certificate:**
   - If the certificate is not properly set up, re-install or configure the certificate as per the guidelines provided by your CA or hosting provider.

4. **Refresh the Page:**
   - Refresh the login page to ensure that any changes to cookies are reflected. This helps prevent logging in with an old cookie name that may no longer be valid. Use the following quick keys based on your browser:
     - **Google Chrome / Firefox / Edge:** `F5` or `Ctrl + R`
     - **Safari (macOS):** `Command + R`
     - **Internet Explorer:** `F5` or `Ctrl + F5` (to refresh and bypass cache)

5. **Test Login Again:**
   - After resolving any SSL or cookie issues, attempt to log in to the website again.
