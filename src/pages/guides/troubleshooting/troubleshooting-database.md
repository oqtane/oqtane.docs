## Database Setup Issues

If you're having trouble setting up your database or connecting it to Oqtane, check the following:

### 1.1. **Database Connection Problems**

- **Check Connection Strings**: Verify the connection strings in your configuration files are correct and point to the right database server.
- **Firewall Settings**: Ensure the database port is open and accessible from your Oqtane server.
- **Database Server Availability**: Ensure the database server is running and accessible. If using a remote database, check network connectivity.

### 1.2. **Missing or Incorrect Database Schema**

- **Schema Migration**: Ensure that your database schema is up-to-date by running the necessary migrations (check the **[Migrations Guide](../migrations/database-migration.md)**).
- **Database Permissions**: Ensure the database user has sufficient permissions to create tables, views, and procedures.

## Database Migrations

Database migrations are a critical part of setting up and maintaining Oqtane's database. Here’s how to troubleshoot migration issues:

### 2.1. **Failed Migrations**

- **Check Logs**: Look for any error messages in your Oqtane logs related to database migrations.
- **Verify Migration Version**: Ensure the database schema version matches the version specified in your Oqtane installation.
- **Re-run Migrations**: If a migration fails, try rerunning it manually or resetting the migration state.

### 2.2. **Version Conflicts**

- **Database Compatibility**: Ensure the Oqtane version you're using is compatible with your database schema version. Upgrading Oqtane may require additional migration steps.
- **Revert to Backup**: If a migration causes severe issues, consider restoring from a database backup and reapplying migrations step by step.

For more details on performing migrations, check the [Database Migration Guide](../migrations/database-migration.md).

## Performance Problems

Performance issues can often be traced back to database queries or configuration settings. Here’s how to troubleshoot them:

### 3.1. **Slow Queries**

- **Enable Query Logging**: Enable query logging in your database to identify slow or resource-intensive queries.
- **Optimize Queries**: Review the slow queries and optimize them using indexing or refactoring.
- **Database Caching**: Implement caching strategies to reduce load on the database, particularly for frequently accessed data.

### 3.2. **Database Load**

- **Database Scaling**: Consider scaling your database horizontally (replication) or vertically (increasing resources).
- **Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling to manage multiple database connections efficiently.

## Database Integrity and Security

Ensuring the integrity and security of your database is crucial. Here’s how to address common database issues:

### 4.1. **Data Corruption**

- **Check Logs for Corruption**: Look for errors indicating data corruption in the database logs.
- **Restore from Backup**: If data corruption occurs, restore the affected tables or the entire database from a backup.
- **Integrity Checks**: Use your database's built-in integrity checking tools (e.g., `DBCC CHECKDB` for SQL Server) to identify corruption.

### 4.2. **Database Security**

- **Database Access Control**: Ensure only authorized users can access the database. Review and tighten user permissions.
- **Encrypt Data**: Implement encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- **Regular Backups**: Schedule regular backups and store them in a secure location.

## General Tips

Here are a few general tips for maintaining and troubleshooting your database:

- **Backup Regularly**: Always keep backups of your database. Schedule daily backups for production environments.
- **Monitor Performance**: Use database monitoring tools to keep an eye on performance metrics like query time, CPU load, and memory usage.
- **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure both your database and Oqtane are kept up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues and benefit from security patches.
