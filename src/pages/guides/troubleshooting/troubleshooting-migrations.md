# Troubleshooting Migrations

## Overview

This guide provides troubleshooting steps for common issues encountered during the migration of Oqtane Framework instances. Whether you're migrating between servers, upgrading versions, or moving from a development to production environment, these solutions will help you address common migration problems.

### Common Migration Issues and Solutions

Below are common migration-related issues and steps to resolve them:

#### 1. **Migration Failures**
   - **Symptoms**: The migration process fails without completing successfully.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Check Logs**: Review the error logs on the source and destination systems for detailed error messages that may indicate the cause of the failure.
     - **Disk Space**: Ensure that the destination environment has enough disk space to accommodate the migrated files and database.
     - **Permissions**: Verify that the user executing the migration has appropriate permissions to access both the source and destination systems and perform the migration tasks.
     - **Dependencies**: Ensure all required services (e.g., database services, web server) are running and compatible between the source and destination environments.

#### 2. **Database Migration Problems**
   - **Symptoms**: Issues arise with the database, such as missing data, schema mismatches, or errors during data transfer.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Check Database Compatibility**: Verify that the database version on the destination server is compatible with the version used in the source environment. If needed, upgrade or downgrade the database accordingly.
     - **Run Migration Scripts**: Ensure all necessary database migration scripts are applied to bring the schema up to date in the destination environment.
     - **Backup and Restore**: If data is missing or corrupted, restore from a backup and reapply the migration scripts if needed.
     - **Database Permissions**: Ensure the database user in the destination environment has full access rights to the necessary tables and schemas.

#### 3. **Configuration Errors**
   - **Symptoms**: Issues with configuration files, such as mismatched settings or incorrect paths.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Update Configuration Files**: Ensure that all configuration files (e.g., `appsettings.json`, database connection strings) are updated with the correct paths, connection strings, and environment-specific settings.
     - **Check File Paths**: Verify that file paths in the configuration are correct and point to valid directories in the new environment.
     - **Environment Variables**: Double-check environment-specific variables, like API keys or SMTP settings, that might need to be reconfigured for the new environment.

#### 4. **File Path and Permission Issues**
   - **Symptoms**: Files, such as themes, modules, or uploaded content, are missing or inaccessible after migration.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Check File Permissions**: Ensure that the destination server has the correct file and folder permissions to access all necessary files. The web server should have read/write access to files and directories.
     - **Verify Paths**: Make sure all file paths in the configuration and code are correctly adjusted for the new environment.
     - **File Transfer Verification**: Ensure that all required files were successfully transferred from the source to the destination system, especially if using manual file transfers.

#### 5. **Broken Links or URLs**
   - **Symptoms**: URLs or internal links are broken after migration.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Update Hardcoded URLs**: Check for any hardcoded URLs in the application, configuration files, or database that reference the source environment and update them to the production environment URLs.
     - **URL Rewriting**: If you're using URL rewrites or redirects, make sure the necessary rules are applied to the new environment.
     - **Cache Issues**: Clear any caches or cookies that may be causing outdated URLs to persist in browsers.

#### 6. **Performance Issues After Migration**
   - **Symptoms**: The migrated Oqtane instance performs slower than expected in the destination environment.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Optimize Database Queries**: Review the database for inefficient queries or missing indexes that could be affecting performance.
     - **Check Server Resources**: Ensure that the destination environment has adequate resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to handle the workload.
     - **Enable Caching**: Make sure caching mechanisms (e.g., application cache, CDN) are properly configured and enabled to improve performance.
     - **Review Web Server Configurations**: Ensure the web server is configured to handle the expected load and traffic (e.g., connection limits, thread pool settings).

#### 7. **User Authentication and Access Issues**
   - **Symptoms**: Users are unable to authenticate, or permissions are incorrectly applied after migration.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Check User Roles**: Ensure user roles and permissions are correctly migrated and applied in the destination environment.
     - **Session State**: Verify that session management is configured correctly, especially if using session state servers or shared caches.
     - **Authentication Providers**: Ensure that authentication providers (e.g., OAuth, Active Directory, custom providers) are properly configured in the destination environment.

### Best Practices for Successful Migrations

To help ensure a smooth migration, follow these best practices:

- **Test the Migration**: Perform a test migration in a staging environment before migrating to production. This will allow you to catch any issues without impacting live systems.
- **Backup Everything**: Always back up your data, files, and configurations before beginning the migration.
- **Check for Dependencies**: Ensure that all dependencies (such as database versions, server configurations, or third-party services) are compatible with the destination environment.
- **Use Automation**: Automate the migration process as much as possible, including database updates, file transfers, and configuration changes.
- **Monitor After Migration**: After completing the migration, monitor the system for any issues, including performance, security, and error logs.

### Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can effectively troubleshoot common migration issues in Oqtane Framework. Whether you are migrating servers, upgrading versions, or moving to a new environment, these solutions will help you address problems and ensure a smooth transition.
