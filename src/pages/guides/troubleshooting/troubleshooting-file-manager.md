# Troubleshooting File Manager

The File Manager in Oqtane provides a way to manage files and assets within the application. However, like any system, it may encounter issues related to file uploads, permissions, and other operational aspects. This guide will help you identify and resolve common problems that may arise while using the File Manager.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. File Upload Failures

**Symptom:**  
Files are not uploading successfully, and you receive an error message such as "File upload failed."

**Solution:**  
- Check the file size limits. Oqtane may have size restrictions on file uploads, which can be configured in the settings or web.config. Ensure that the file being uploaded does not exceed these limits.
- Review the permissions of the directory where files are being uploaded. The File Manager needs appropriate read/write permissions to function correctly.
- If the error persists, check the application logs for more specific error messages related to file handling or permissions.

### 2. File Type Restrictions

**Symptom:**  
Certain file types are not being uploaded or are being rejected by the system.

**Solution:**  
- Verify that the file type is allowed in the Oqtane File Manager configuration. You may need to modify the allowed file types list if certain types are restricted.
- If the file type should be allowed, check the server's MIME type configuration to ensure that the file type is registered correctly for upload.

### 3. Missing Files After Upload

**Symptom:**  
Files appear to upload successfully, but they are not visible in the File Manager afterward.

**Solution:**  
- Check the destination folder in the File Manager to confirm that the file was uploaded to the correct directory.
- Ensure that the correct file path is set in the system configuration, and check for any issues with the server's file system.
- Verify that the File Manager is correctly displaying files from the uploaded directory. If necessary, refresh the view to load the updated list of files.

### 4. Permissions Issues with Files and Folders

**Symptom:**  
Users are unable to access or modify files within the File Manager due to permission issues.

**Solution:**  
- Check the file and folder permissions to ensure that the appropriate users or roles have the necessary access to read, write, or delete files.
- If running on a Linux/Unix server, make sure that the file permissions are correctly set (`chmod` command) and that the file ownership is correct (`chown` command).
- On Windows, check the file/folder permissions in the File Explorer and ensure the IIS user or web app pool identity has the correct rights.

### 5. File Manager Interface Not Loading or Crashing

**Symptom:**  
The File Manager interface fails to load or crashes during usage.

**Solution:**  
- Check for any JavaScript errors in the browser's developer console that could be preventing the File Manager from functioning properly.
- Verify that all necessary JavaScript and CSS files for the File Manager are loaded properly. If files are missing or not being served, they may need to be re-deployed.
- Clear your browser's cache and cookies to resolve any residual issues related to outdated files.
- Ensure that your Oqtane application is running the latest version, as issues with the File Manager could have been addressed in recent updates.

### 6. Error Messages on File Deletion

**Symptom:**  
An error message appears when attempting to delete a file from the File Manager.

**Solution:**  
- Check if the file is currently in use or locked by another process. Ensure that no other application or user has the file open when attempting to delete it.
- Review the file permissions to ensure that the user attempting the deletion has the necessary rights to remove the file.
- If the file deletion fails, check the Oqtane logs for more details about the error or any file system-related issues.

3. **Check File Paths:**  
   Ensure that the file paths configured in Oqtane (either through settings or web.config) are correct and accessible by the server.
