# Migrating Oqtane Framework from Development to Production

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for migrating an Oqtane Framework instance from a development environment to a production environment. It covers preparation steps, configuration adjustments, and troubleshooting tips to ensure a smooth migration and deployment.

### Steps for Migrating Oqtane from Development to Production

Follow the steps below to successfully migrate your Oqtane instance to a production environment:

#### 1. **Prepare the Development Environment for Migration**
   - **Ensure All Features Are Tested**: Before migrating, thoroughly test all modules, features, and configurations in your development environment to ensure everything works as expected.
   - **Backup Data and Configuration**: Take a backup of your development database, configuration files, and any custom content or themes you've created.
   - **Check Version Compatibility**: Ensure that the Oqtane Framework version you're using in development is the same or compatible with the version you're installing in production.

#### 2. **Prepare the Production Environment**
   - **Set Up the Production Server**: Install and configure all necessary components (e.g., web server, database, application server) in your production environment.
   - **Set Appropriate File Permissions**: Ensure that your production environment has the correct file permissions, especially for uploads, logs, and configuration files.
   - **Configure Security Settings**: Set up SSL certificates, configure firewalls, and ensure that production security best practices are in place.
   - **Set Database Connection Strings**: Adjust the connection strings in your production environment to point to your production database server.

#### 3. **Deploy the Oqtane Framework to Production**
   - **Deploy Files**: Copy all files from your development environment (including modules, themes, and content) to your production server.
   - **Update Database**: If necessary, run any database migrations or schema updates required to bring the database in sync with the production environment.
   - **Update Configuration Settings**: Modify any configuration settings (such as `appsettings.json`) to match the production environment, including things like logging levels, email settings, and application-specific parameters.

#### 4. **Testing in the Production Environment**
   - **Verify the Application**: Once the migration is complete, thoroughly test the application in the production environment to ensure all features and functionalities work correctly.
   - **Test Performance**: Ensure that performance is optimal by testing load times, page responses, and checking for bottlenecks.
   - **Check Security Configurations**: Verify that SSL is enabled, authentication methods are working, and access control is enforced.

#### 5. **Go Live**
   - **DNS Configuration**: Update your DNS settings to point to your production server.
   - **Monitor the Application**: Use monitoring tools to track server performance, logs, and errors in the production environment.

### Troubleshooting Migration Issues

If you encounter issues during the migration, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

- **Configuration Mismatches**: Ensure that all environment-specific settings (such as database connection strings, file paths, and email settings) are updated in the production environment.
- **Missing Files**: Check that all necessary files from development (such as themes, modules, and content) were copied to the production server.
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure that your production environment has the correct file permissions for writing logs, caching, and other necessary operations.
- **Database Connectivity Issues**: Ensure the production server can connect to the production database and that the schema is up to date.
- **Broken Links or URLs**: Double-check any hardcoded URLs or references in configuration files that might be pointing to the development environment.

### Best Practices for Production Environments
- **Regular Backups**: Set up regular backups for your production database and files.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions for error tracking and performance metrics.
- **Scaling**: Ensure your production server is capable of handling the anticipated traffic, with the option to scale resources as needed.

This guide helps ensure that your Oqtane Framework instance is ready for production and that any migration issues can be efficiently resolved.
