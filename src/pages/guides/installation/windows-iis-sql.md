# Install Oqtane Using Windows, IIS and MS SQL Server

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the steps to install Oqtane on a Windows system using Internet Information Services (IIS) as the web server and Microsoft SQL Server as the database backend. We'll also use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for database management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Windows machine with administrative privileges.
- Internet Information Services (IIS) installed.
- Microsoft SQL Server installed, along with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

## Step 1: Enable Internet Information Services (IIS)

1. Open the "Turn Windows features on or off" menu next to the Windows Start button.
2. Enable Internet Information Services (IIS), ensuring that the  [WebSocket Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/websockets?#enabling-websockets-on-iis) is enabled and WebDAV Publishing is disabled.
3. Click OK to complete the installation.

## Step 2: Install URL Rewrite Module

1. Navigate to the [Url Rewrite Module](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite) page.
2. Download and install the module.

## Step 3: Install .NET Core Hosting Bundle

1. Navigate to the [.NET Core Hosting Bundle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) page.
2. Download and install the Windows hosting bundle.
3. Restart your machine.

## Step 4: Install Microsoft SQL Server

1. Download and install [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).
2. Ensure that you enable SQL Server Authentication mode during the installation process.
3. During the installation, choose the option to enable TCP/IP protocol for network communication.

## Step 5: Install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

1. Download and install [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).

## Step 6: Configure SQL Server

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
2. Connect to your SQL Server instance.
3. Create a new database for Oqtane.
4. Optionally, create a new SQL Server login or use an existing one for Oqtane.

## Step 7: Download and Extract Oqtane

1. Download the latest release of Oqtane from the [Oqtane Releases](https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework/releases/latest) page.
2. Extract the files to your desired directory.

## Step 8: Configure IIS App Pool

1. Open "Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager" from the Start menu.
2. Create a new Application Pool named "oqtane" with No Managed Code for the .NET CLR version.
3. Set appropriate permissions for the folder containing the Oqtane files.

_Note: Ensure that the folder containing the Oqtane files has appropriate modify permissions set for the "IIS AppPool\oqtane" user to avoid any permission issues during installation or runtime._

## Step 9: Configure IIS Website

1. In IIS Manager, right-click on Sites and select "Add Website".
2. Provide a name and choose the "oqtane" Application Pool.
3. Specify the path to the Oqtane files and a host name (e.g., "oqtane.dev").

## Step 10: Add a Host Entry (Optional)

1. Open Notepad as Administrator.
2. Open the "hosts" file located in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc.
3. Add an entry mapping the host name to 127.0.0.1, e.g., 127.0.0.1 oqtane.dev.
4. Save the file.

## Step 11: Navigate to the Site

1. Open your favorite web browser.
2. Navigate to the specified host name, e.g., http://oqtane.dev.
3. You should now see the Oqtane installation wizard. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
