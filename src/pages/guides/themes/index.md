# Oqtane Themes Guide

> Oqtane Themes are extensions to customize the look and feel of your Oqtane website.
> This guide will help you get started with creating and using themes in Oqtane.

## What is a Theme?

A theme is a collection of files that define the look and feel of your website.
Themes can include CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets that are used to style your website.

Since Oqtane is based on .net and Blazor, themes are built using Blazor components
and these are compiled into a DLL that is loaded by the Oqtane framework.
Here's an example:

<img src="./assets/oqtane-theme-blazor-cms.org.jpg" class="full-width">

In this example, the theme controls:

1. Placement, size and styling of the logo - as well as how it changes in responsive scenarios.
2. The layout of the main menu, including the dropdowns.
3. The layout of the footer, including the social media links.
4. Font sizes and colors for various headings and normal text.
