# Build and Deploy the Documentation

## Setup

To set everything up, clone the oqtane.docs and the oqtane.framework repositories
in the same parent folder (e.g., `c:\projects\oqtane`), creating a structure like:

* `c:\projects\oqtane` (example)
  * `oqtane.docs` cloned from [oqtane.docs](https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.docs)
  * `oqtane.framework` cloned from [oqtane.framework](https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework)

```text
some-root\
â”œâ”€â”€ oqtane.docs
â”œâ”€â”€ oqtane.framework
```

That will look like this:

## Build and Test Locally

Depending on your preferred toolchain, you can use

1. [VS Code](#build-and-test-locally-using-vs-code)  (recommendedðŸŒŸ)
2. [Visual Studio 2022](#build-and-test-locally-using-visual-studio-2022)

### Build and Test Locally using VS Code

1. Run with VS Code:

    * Open the `Oqtane.Docs.code-workspace` workspace located in the `/src` folder.

    * Rebuild the entire solution
        * Either using `Ctrl+Shift+B`.

        * Or by hitting `Ctrl + Shift + P` and selecting "Run Task"  
          ![VS Code Run Task](./assets/vs-code-run-task.jpg)  
          ...and then "Build".  
          ![VS Code Build](./assets/vs-code-build.jpg)

    * In the output you should then see a bunch of stuff - ending with `Build Succeeded`  
      ![VS Code Build Successful](./assets/vs-code-build-succeeded.jpg)

    * It is generated into the root `/docs` folder.

2. Test Locally - three options:

    * _Recommended ðŸŒŸ:_ Use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
      extension to serve the `/docs` folder on <http://localhost:5500`> using `Alt + L, Alt + O`.

    * _Alternatively:_ Use [IIS Express Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=warren-buckley.iis-express)
      to serve the `/docs` folder on <http://localhost:27629`> using `Ctrl+F5`.

    * _Alternatively:_ [Set up IIS](./run-in-iis.md) to publish the `/docs` folder on a domain
      such as `docs.oqtane.me`.



### Build and Test Locally using Visual Studio 2022

1. Run with Visual Studio:

   * Open the `Oqtane.Docs.sln` solution located in the `/src` folder.
   ![VS 2022 Docs Solution](./assets/vs-2022-docs-solution.png)

   * Rebuild the entire solution. It is generated into the root `/docs` folder.
   ![VS 2022 Build Successful](./assets/vs-2022-build-successful.png)

2. Test Locally

   * _Alternatively:_ [Set up IIS](./run-in-iis.md) to publish the `/docs` folder on a domain
      such as `docs.oqtane.me`.
