# Folders and Files in the Oqtane Docs Project

## API Documentation Folders

1. The `api` folder contains the home-page for the API docs. 
1. The `apidoc` folder contains markdown `.md` files which are merged with comments in the code.  


The merging happens because the unique ID of the `md` files matches the full namespace of the code. 

## Article Folders

1. The `articles` folder contains general articles
1. The `how-to` folder
1. The `specs` folder contains specifications, concepts etc.  
	IDs of Contents in this folder should start with `Specs`


## Assets Folders

We recommend placing all assets - mostly images - in `assets` subfolders everywhere. This ensures that the image really belongs to that folder and can be deleted again, if not in use.
