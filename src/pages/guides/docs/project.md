# Oqtane Documentation Project

There are kind of internal notes for the project team.
It's based on various discussions in the team and the community.

## Docs Team

The docs team is responsible for the documentation of Oqtane.
It currently consists of:

* [@iJungleboy](https://github.com/iJungleboy) (Team Lead)
* [@thebaum](https://github.com/thabaum)
* [@GregStevenson](https://github.com/GregStevenson)

## Top Level View

Things to consider for the docs project

* [Content](#content): breadth, depth and quality of docs
* [Maintenance / Timeliness](#maintenance): keep docs up to date with features & changes
* [Use](#use): get people to find use the docs
* [Contribute](#contribute): get people to contribute

## Content

This covers a lot of areas:

1. Content Breadth, Depth and Quality
1. Code Documentation - volume and quality  
   _These are the XML comments in the source code which are maintained in the main repo_
1. Backgrounds / Concepts  
   _These are the "What is Oqtane" and "What is a Module" type of docs_
   which both help understand something, and often serve as background for other docs.
   Without these backgrounds, pages will tend to repeat the same information since there's no primary link.
1. User Help (what does this dialog / button do)
1. Guides / How-To
1. Link other resources

## Maintenance

Things we should consider for maintenance

1. new features
1. changes in Oqtane which result in
    1. different UIs
    1. different ways to do things as a user
    1. different ways to develop something

## Use

Bring people to docs
eg. move "Getting Started" from Github to docs and link from Github/Oqtane

## Contribute

Questions

1. what motivates people to contribute to docs?
1. how can we make it easy to contribute?
1. can we provide benefits or visibility to contributors?
