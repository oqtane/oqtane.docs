# System Update

The system update feature allows you to update the Oqtane framework to keep your website up to date and ensure that administrators will have access to all capabilities and features that Oqtane provides. The system update feature also provides the ability to upload a Nuget package to be included with your local version of the Oqtane framework and is uploaded by selecting the Nuget file from its location on your system and then pressing the upload button to place the Nuget package within a version of the framework, then pressing the install button to update you version of the framework to include the uploaded Nuget package. Uploading a Nuget package is for the use of uploading features that exist in a newer version of Oqtane, but you have not installed the newest version of Oqtane.
