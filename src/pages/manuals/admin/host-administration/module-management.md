# Module Management

The module manager provides a list of all of the modules that are currently installed in your version of the Oqtane framework. Modules are a key feature of Oqtane and allow for a variety of features to be placed on your pages. 

At the top of the module manager page there is a install button to install a module from the list provided or by using the upload tab, you can use a Nuget package of a module, so that it will be included as one of the possible modules to use on the site.

Inside the list of modules there is also the options to edit modules which will show an overview of the module with a description and an option to delete any module that is not a default Oqtane module.
