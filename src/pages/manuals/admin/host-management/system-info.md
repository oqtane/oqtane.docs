# System Info

All of the general information that you need to know about the Oqtane framework is available in the system information feature, which includes things like the Oqtane framework version, the blazor runtime, the server path, the CLR version, the OS version, and the server's current time. 

The System Info feature also provides access to Oqtane's API with many of Oqtane's methods and the ability to try them out using the Swagger user interface.
There is also the option to restart the Oqtane framework on this page if you have made a change to the system that would require a restart such as installing or deleting themes or modules.
