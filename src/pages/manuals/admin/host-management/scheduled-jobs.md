# Scheduled Jobs

The Schedule page enables you to manage what is essentially recurring, scheduled batch processing for Oqtane.There are many instances where a host may want to set something up to automatically do some task like sending a notification to users and this can be accomplished with the use of this feature. The options that are available on this page are:

* Add Job: Adds a new job by filling out the fields of:
    * Name: Choose the jobs name.
    * Type: Specify the type by either using NotificationJob or by creating your own job method in the infrastructure.jobs class in the Oqtane server. You will need to specify the location of the job in the framework, Ex. (Oqtane.Infrastructure.NotificationJob, Oqtane.Server) with the job being a notification job from the infrastructure class, which is a class inside of the Oqtane.Server.
    * Enabled: A yes or no to say if you want the job to be active at this time or not.
    * Runs Every: Choose an amount of time that specifies how often the job will execute.
    * Starting: Enter a date for when you want the job to start.
    * Ending: Enter a date for when you want the job to end.
