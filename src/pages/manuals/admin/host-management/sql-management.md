# SQL Management

The SQL console permits database access directly from inside Oqtane. So the host, even if it's not near an instance of SQL Server Management Studio, still has access to a powerful database tool. This allows for SQL statements to be run directly from the Oqtane application onto the tenants which are also called databases. The results of any SQL query that is run will be returned directly below the execute button.
