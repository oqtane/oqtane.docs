# Site Settings

### SMTP Server (Secure Mail Transfer Protocol)
The Oqtane instance sends outbound email for a variety of reasons, from the host or site admin or in the form of password reminders, event notifications, newsletters, or other business-specific use cases. A valid SMTP server is required for this to work; you should consult your network administrator for the appropriate credentials to use in a production configuration. Most non-Exchange Server SMTP hosts will require “Basic” authentication and a valid username/password combination. Some will also require that SSL be enabled.
* Host: Enter the host name for the server.
* Port: Enter the port number that the server is on.
* SSL Enabled: Specify yes or no if the SMTP server has an SSL certificate.
* Username: Enter the username for the SMTP server you are accessing.
* Password: Enter the password for the SMTP server you are accessing.
