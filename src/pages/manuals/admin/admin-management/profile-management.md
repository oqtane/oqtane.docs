# Profile Management

The profile manager exposes one of the more powerful and under-appreciated features that Oqtane has to offer. The profile manager expose to you a few features, but the primary feature is the profile editor, which allows you to customize completely the profile fields that a user account has in nearly every way possible. This is the backbone of all of the user profile features in Oqtane.
The Oqtane profile manager allows for a user to specify more things about themselves than the typical information from a basic user account. Fields from the profile can be made to be required upon making an account such as making a name or address a required field.
