title: Oqtane Documentation Namespace

This namespace contains attributes like `PublicApi` which mark code as public, private, internal, etc.
Depending on what attributes you add to your code it will appear in the generated docs,
and possibly have a warning or something attached.

Typical use:

```cs
[PublicApi]
public class YourClass {
  // this will be documented without any special comments
  // because we're not using the <summary> tag
  public string Name;

  /// <summary>
  /// This will be documented with this text in the summary
  /// </summary>
  public string Something;

  /// <summary>
  /// This won't appear in the public documentation
  /// </summary>
  [PrivateApi("Don't publish this - should only be used internally")]
  public string InternalSpecialName;

  /// <summary>
  /// This will appear in the docs, but Work-In-Progress is clearly visible
  /// </summary>
  [WorkInProgressApi("We're not done yet, may change")]
  public string NotDoneYet;

  /// <summary>
  /// This will appear in the docs, but with a warning
  /// </summary>
  [InternalApi_DoNotUse_MayChangeWithoutNotice("This may help you, but please don't use it")]
  public string YouShouldKnowAboutThisButNotUseIt;
}
```
