    "title": "404 Page Behavior | Oqtane Docs - APIs and more for the Modular Blazor Application Framework",
    "keywords": "404 Page Behavior Issue Description This document aims to provide clarity on the behavior of the 404 page in the Oqtane Framework. It includes information on various scenarios where the 404 page is encountered and how it is handled within the framework. Use Cases The 404 page is utilized in multiple scenarios within the Oqtane Framework: Page Not Found: When a user requests a URL that does not correspond to any existing page in the site, and it has not been mapped using URL Mapping, the user is redirected to the 404 page. Unauthorized Access: If a user attempts to access a page for which they do not have permission, they are redirected to the 404 page instead of revealing the existence of the page. Effective Date and Expiry Date: If a page exists but the current date is outside the range specified by the Effective Date and Expiry Date, the user is directed to the 404 page. Framework Behavior In the Oqtane Framework, the term \"404\" refers to the friendly page that users are redirected to when the framework is unable to navigate them to the requested URL. This page has a path of \"/404\". Regarding permissions, there has been debate about whether to strictly adhere to HTTP status codes or to prioritize security by not revealing the existence of pages to unauthorized users. As of now, Oqtane has opted for a single \"friendly\" page for handling these scenarios. Reference For more details and discussions on this topic, refer to issue #4088 in the Oqtane Framework repository. Conclusion By understanding the behavior of the 404 page in the Oqtane Framework, administrators can better manage and customize the user experience when encountering non-existent or unauthorized URLs."

    "keywords": "Oqtane Concepts: DLL Handling How / Why DLLs are loaded into memory: the .NET Core philosophy is to only load the specific assemblies an app needs ( to reduce startup time and memory ) by default .NET Core will only load assemblies statically linked to the main app - it will not load every DLL in the /bin it will not load Oqtane module/theme DLLs as these are dynamically linked therefore Oqtane needs to manually load its modules/themes in order to do this it needs to be able to quickly identify the DLLs the only option available is via filename, as any other approach requires reflection which consumes startup time/processing and memory the convention is that the filename must contain oqtane once the required DLLs are loaded into the AppDomain, subsequent operations for assemblies can use the AppDomain rather than the file system the majority of assemblies in the AppDomain are not relevant to Oqtane reflection is expensive so we should only use reflection on assemblies which are actually relevant to Oqtane assembly fullname is same as DLL filename, so we can look for the oqtane qualifier to identify Oqtane assemblies"

    "title": "Best Practices for Oqtane Development | Oqtane Docs - APIs and more for the Modular Blazor Application Framework",
    "keywords": "Best Practices for Oqtane Development This guide provides essential best practices for developing and maintaining an Oqtane-based application. By following these guidelines, you can ensure a more efficient, scalable, and secure development experience. 1. Organize Your Modules and Themes 1.1 Modular Design Oqtane follows a modular architecture that enables you to extend its functionality by creating custom modules. When developing a new feature, it's recommended to: Keep features encapsulated in their own modules for easier maintenance. Follow the single responsibility principle: each module should focus on one area of functionality. 1.2 Consistent Theme Structure Themes are essential for the visual look of your application. Follow these practices for managing themes: Use a consistent folder structure for assets (CSS, images, scripts). Separate core theme styles from custom modifications. Maintain responsive design practices to ensure compatibility across devices. 2. Secure Your Application 2.1 Use Secure Communication (SSL/TLS) Always use SSL/TLS for your Oqtane application, especially for production environments. This ensures secure communication between clients and servers. Set up HTTPS for your web application. Use strong certificates and avoid using expired or self-signed certificates in production. 2.2 Secure User Authentication Make sure to implement strong authentication practices: Use two-factor authentication (2FA) for administrative accounts. Regularly review and update user roles and permissions. Implement password strength policies and encourage users to update their passwords periodically. 2.3 Protect Sensitive Data When dealing with sensitive data, ensure encryption and secure storage: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit. Use secure storage solutions for user credentials, such as hashing algorithms for passwords. 3. Optimize Performance 3.1 Enable Caching Enable caching where appropriate to improve the performance of your Oqtane site: Use the built-in caching mechanisms in Oqtane to store static content. Cache database queries and frequently accessed data to reduce load on the server. 3.2 Optimize Database Queries Efficient database interactions are key to performance: Avoid complex queries that may impact performance. Regularly review the database schema to ensure it is optimized for the queries it serves. 3.3 Minimize Frontend Asset Size Minimize the size of your frontend assets: Use minified versions of CSS and JavaScript files. Combine smaller CSS and JS files into single files to reduce HTTP requests. 4. Maintainable Code and Version Control 4.1 Use Version Control (Git) Make sure your codebase is under version control, and follow these best practices: Create meaningful commit messages. Use feature branches for new development and keep the main branch stable. 4.2 Code Reviews Before merging new features or changes, perform code reviews: Review for code quality, consistency, and adherence to Oqtane best practices. Test the code in different environments (development, staging, production). 5. Backup and Recovery Strategy 5.1 Regular Backups Create regular backups for your Oqtane application, including: The application files and configuration. The database, especially before and after migrations. 5.2 Disaster Recovery Plan Develop a disaster recovery plan that includes: Restoring the application from a backup. Handling server outages or data corruption. 6. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing 6.1 Maintain Clear Documentation Ensure that your code and processes are well-documented: Write clear documentation for custom modules, themes, and configuration settings. Update documentation regularly to reflect changes in functionality. 6.2 Share Knowledge with Your Team Encourage team collaboration by: Sharing best practices and lessons learned with other developers. Maintaining an internal knowledge base for troubleshooting and solutions."

Because of this, we use a special trick where a JavaScript in layout\\oqtane\\toc.extension.js optimizes the names based on some rules. Here's what it does The prefix Oqtane. is removed by default (unless that's all there is) If the remaining namespace has more than 2 parts, it will be truncated with a prefix ... to make it fit better 😎 In addition, it looks up if the namespace has metadata (in the namespace-metadata.js) to give it better colors and icons."

This is your code: namespace Oqtane.Example; public class MyClass { } Now go to the documentation project Oqtane.Docs in the solution and open the apidoc\\Example folder (create it, if it doesn't exist yet'). In this, create a MyClass.md file which contains this --- uid: Oqtane.Example.MyClass --- Here is some **great** additional [Information](https://oqtane.org). 1. Do this 1.

Images / Files / Assets When using files, especially images, please follow these conventions. 1. Remember: Case Sensitive when Hosted Be aware that the final docs will be hosted on github, which is case-sensitive. So MyImage.png and myimage.png are different files This is important when you're linking to files Always use lower-case file names Note If you accidentally get this wrong (eg. MyImage.png), and linking myimage.png it will work on your IIS/Windows, but not when finally hosted on Github. 2. Put Files Close to Where They Are Used Put all files in the assets folder below the page where they are used. This makes it easier to find the files when you're editing the page. It also makes it easier to move the page to a different location. This also helps to \"see\" when files are not used any more. Only use files in the \"own\" asset folder. Don't use files from far-away asset folders. 3. Use Relative Paths ./assets/myimage.png or assets/myimage.png Rarely ../assets/myimage.png (only if you're in a sub-folder), but the file is still part of the same topic and should be reused 4. Creativity and Contribution There’s no hard and fast rule about how you create or edit images and videos. Any contribution is welcome. Feel free to use tools that you’re comfortable with. For instance, Windows Screen Snippet is a fast and easy tool for creating and saving files. Remember, the goal is to make the documentation as clear and helpful as possible."

Basically this says what code it should pick up, where the .md files are and where to put the output. We've tried to make it very clear where we made relevant changes and smuggled comment-nodes into the file for clarity. Layout The layout is configured in the docfx.json where it will start with the default template, extend it with statictoc (generate real html menu-structures, not just JS) and then apply the layout specified in layout\\oqtane. It will also include images in layout\\images like logos etc. because this was configured in docfx.json. Site Navigation The site navigation is cascaded through the toc.yml files in each folder. Tip You may also find examples online which use toc.md files but you'll run into requirements that will force you to switch back to YAML. So we recommend you stick to the yaml format everywhere. What Code is included in the Docs The initial set is configured in the docfx.json with the base path cwd and include/filter files. Then we have a few basic rules, which are all configured in the filterConfig.yml file. Ignore all Microsoft.*, System.* and Oqtane.Test.* namespaces Troubleshooting Problems with MSBuild or .net SDK DocFX runs MSBuild to compile the projects it finds. This can easily cause trouble if your Dev-PC has been through various versions of Visual-Studio. If you need to troubleshoot this, best contact iJungleboy on GitHub. Problems with Old / Unexpected Results MSBuild will compile everything into the obj folder of this docs-project. This is used as a cache for the next builds. If you run into unexpected results, always clean out the obj folder first. Problems with Github links DocFX automatically links all the auto-generated docs with the git-repo. So make sure that the oqtane.framework is pulled from the official location https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework - otherwise the links will point to another repo."

The Source Code This project has a src folder containing... markdown files in /pages for standalone docs pages markdown files in /apidoc for merging with XML-docs in the source of Oqtane various YAML files (.yml) which describe the navigation structure Solution (.sln) and project (.csproj) files to build the documentation docfx configurations (docfx.json and filterConfig.yml) various json configs so it also works in VS-Code It also requires the Oqtane.Framework project to be in a sibling folder (see setup) The Build Process flowchart TD CS[Oqtane C# Source\\n<code>../../oqtane.framework</code>] -->|⚙️Compiler| XD XD[\"Xml Docs\\n(temp)\"] --> MD[\"Merged API Docs\\n(temp)\"] DM[Docs Mixins\\n~/apidocs] --> MD CONTENT[Content/Articles\\n~/pages] --> Docs[Docs HTML\\n../docs/] ASS[Assets/Images\\n**/assets] --> Docs MD --> Docs TOC[\"TOC Files\\n**/toc.yml\"] --> TOCG Docs -->|generate| TOCG[\"Various TOCs\\n(Tables of Contents)\"] When you build this project, it will Compile Oqtane Extract the XML documentation from Oqtane and generate YAML and markdown files Merge the generated files with the ones in this project Generate a ../docs folder with static HTML files that can be hosted anywhere Note To test the generated docs locally, you'll need to host the ../docs folder on a web server. This is because there are some absolute paths used in some JavaScripts for the TOC (table of contents) and search functionality. The setup is explained below.

Use VS Code instead of Visual Studio VS Code is much lighter and faster than visual studio. It also has some neat features which will help, like: Markdown preview Markdown linting Live Server to see the built docs without having to setup IIS Install Recommended Extensions The VS Code docs project has recommended extensions which will help you be more productive. If you open the project the first time, it will ask you to install them. To install them later, go to the extensions tab and find the \"Show Recommended Extensions\". Use VS Code Preview VS-Code has a nice preview built in: But the improved Markdown Preview Enhanced extension is even better, as it even supports Mermaid. Learn Keyboard Shortcuts Build the docs using Ctrl + Alt + B. Use Live Server for Preview The Live Server extension lets you see the built docs without having to setup IIS. It also automatically refreshes the browser on every change, making it super-comfy. Install the extension run it using Alt + L, Alt + O... ...or by clicking the \"Go Live\" button in the status bar Use Markdown Linting Install the Markdown Lint extension. Disable Xml-Docs While Editing Content Rebuilding everything incl. the XML-docs from the Oqtane source code takes much longer than just building the docs from the markdown files. On my PC (iJungleboy) it takes about 32 seconds vs. 10 seconds. You want fast rebuilds while editing content (eg. not updating docs from the Oqtane source code). To \"temporarily\" disable the Xml-Docs, change the /docfx.json file from: { \"metadata\": [ { // Blank src sample // This should be used when making changes to the theme and wanting to see changes quickly, as it skips parsing the source code // To use, rename this to \"src\" and rename the real src to \"dummy-src\" while developing, then revert when done \"dummy-src\": [], // Oqtane Source Code - where it will extract the API docs from \"src\": [ to { \"metadata\": [ { // Blank src sample // This should be used when making changes to the theme and wanting to see changes quickly, as it skips parsing the source code // To use, rename this to \"src\" and rename the real src to \"dummy-src\" while developing, then revert when done \"src\": [], // Oqtane Source Code - where it will extract the API docs from \"-src\": [ Tip Don't forget to undo this change before committing your changes."

    "keywords": "Oqtane Dev Best Practices: Separate Solutions for Each Extension To create custom themes and modules, you will typically create them in a separate solution. This has benefits such as: Your code base and the git-repos are small and focused. It helps keep your code organized and makes it easier to share your work with others. It allows you to more easily update the Oqtane runtime without affecting your custom code. It ensures your extensions actually work in a vanilla Oqtane. Typically these projects and solutions will have the following folder structure: /parent /oqtane.framework /SomeTheme /SomeModule /SomeOtherExtension This structure allows the modules to easily deploy the build output to the oqtane.framework folder, so it can be run in the Oqtane after every build. Tip Oqtane has built in assistants to generate template modules and themes. These will follow the above convention and also generate build-projects which will deploy the output to the oqtane.framework folder. Tip As you get more experienced, you can then adjust these automatic mechanisms to better suit your own workflow. In this setup, most Oqtane Modules/Themes will also reference the Oqtane framework project - but only to make it easier to run and debug directly from Visual Studio."

This is not about building/distributing Oqtane itself, but about building and distributing your own Themes and Modules. Background Oqtane is a .net 8.0 Blazor application that is designed to be modular and extensible. This means that you can create your own modules, themes, and other extensions to customize your Oqtane solution. To get comfortable with Oqtane, you will need to understand how to package and distribute your themes and modules. We want to cover the following topics: What is a Build and What's Inside it? How does the Build Process Work? What is a package? What is a deployment? Build and deploy during development Build and deploy for distribution Distribute through Nuget, Github and the Oqtane Marketplace Basics: What is a Build and What's Inside it? A build is the process of taking your work preparing it to run. When we say your work this usually means: Your C# code Your Blazor code Your HTML, CSS, JavaScript Any additional images, fonts, etc. The build is usually done by Visual Studio and typically involves 3 steps: Compiling any JavaScript, SASS etc. using Webpack Compiling your C# and Razor code into one .net assembly Deploying the results, together with any other files (eg. supporting DLLs) deployment can be into other folders, or into a Nuget package How does the Build Process Work? The build process is usually done by Visual Studio. If you follow the current conventions, you will have a dedicated project called Oqtane...Package which is only responsible for the building process. Tip If you only build the main project, the result will just sit around and do nothing. You must build the package project to see anything useful. What is Triggered by the Build Process? The build process is configured in the Oqtane...Package.csproj file, explained here: <Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\"> <!-- some parts skipped for brevity --> <!-- This is where the distribution / package steps are configured, \"PostBuild\" --> <Target Name=\"PostBuild\" AfterTargets=\"PostBuildEvent\"> <!-- If Windows and creating a Dev-Build, Run \"debug.cmd\" --> <Exec Condition=\"'$(OS)' == 'Windows_NT' And '$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'\" Command=\"debug.cmd\" /> <!-- If Mac/Linux and creating a Dev-Build, Run \"debug.sh\" using bash --> <Exec Condition=\"'$(OS)' != 'Windows_NT' And '$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'\" Command=\"bash $(ProjectDir)debug.sh\" /> <!-- If Windows and creating a Release-Build, Run \"release.cmd\" --> <Exec Condition=\"'$(OS)' == 'Windows_NT' And '$(Configuration)' == 'Release'\" Command=\"release.cmd\" /> <!-- If Mac/Linux and creating a Release-Build, Run \"release.sh\" using bash --> <Exec Condition=\"'$(OS)' != 'Windows_NT' And '$(Configuration)' == 'Release'\" Command=\"bash $(ProjectDir)release.sh\" /> </Target> </Project> What Happens in a Dev-Build? ➡️ Read more about the Dev-Build What Happens in a Release-Build? ➡️ Read more about the Release-Build What's missing here?

This is the typical release.cmd for a release-build: del \"*.nupkg\" \"..\\..\\oqtane.framework\\oqtane.package\\nuget.exe\" pack Oqtane.Theme.Arsha.nuspec XCOPY \"*.nupkg\" \"..\\..\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\wwwroot\\Themes\\\" /Y As you can see, it will Delete any previous Nuget packages Use nuget.exe to pack the Nuget package instructions from the .nuspec file Copy the Nuget package into the wwwroot\\Themes folder of the Oqtane.Server project Tip The same warnings apply as for the debug.cmd - you may need to adjust paths and names. What is a (Nuget) Package? A package is a collection of files that are bundled together. In Oqtane, they are distributed in a .nupkg file, which is a Nuget package. Internally, a Nuget package is a ZIP file with a specific structure, so for discovery you can just rename a nuget package to .zip and open it. The definition of what goes inside a package is defined in a .nuspec file. The compiler will call nuget.exe and give it a NuSpec file to create the package. ➡️ see also Oqtane Extension - Nuget Package What is a NuSpec file? Here is an example of a .nuspec file: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <package xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd\"> <!-- Package information if publishing on Nuget.org --> <metadata> <!-- Nuget ID, must be unique to this extension --> <id>Oqtane.Theme.Arsha</id> <!-- Version, Copyright, URL etc. --> <version>1.0.0</version> <authors>Oqtane Labs Inc</authors> <owners>Oqtane Labs Inc</owners> <title>Arsha</title> <description>Arsha Theme for Oqtane</description> <copyright>Oqtane Labs Inc</copyright> <requireLicenseAcceptance>false</requireLicenseAcceptance> <license type=\"expression\">MIT</license> <projectUrl>https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework</projectUrl> <!-- Icon file to be shown eg. on nuget.org, if published there --> <icon>icon.png</icon> <tags>oqtane theme</tags> <releaseNotes></releaseNotes> <summary></summary> <!-- Dependencies, in this case the Oqtane.Framework - These will be listed on Nuget.org (if you publish it there) - Oqtane may also check if they are installed before allowing installation --> <dependencies> <dependency id=\"Oqtane.Framework\" version=\"5.1.0\" /> </dependencies> </metadata> <!-- Files to be included in the package --> <files> <!-- DLLs and PDBs (PDBs contains line-numbers for debugging exceptions) --> <file src=\"..\\Client\\bin\\Release\\net8.0\\Oqtane.Theme.Arsha.Client.Oqtane.dll\" target=\"lib\\net8.0\" /> <file src=\"..\\Client\\bin\\Release\\net8.0\\Oqtane.Theme.Arsha.Client.Oqtane.pdb\" target=\"lib\\net8.0\" /> <!-- All the files in your main projects wwwroot --> <file src=\"..\\Client\\wwwroot\\**\\*.*\" target=\"wwwroot\" /> <!-- Icon file, located in the same folder as the nuspec file --> <file src=\"icon.png\" target=\"\" /> </files> </package> Release Build FAQs What is a DLL and a PDB? A DLL is a Dynamic Link Library, which is a compiled .NET assembly. It contains the compiled code of your project, and can be executed by the .NET runtime. A PDB is a Program Database, which contains additional information for debugging. It contains line-numbers, variable names, and other information that can be used to debug exceptions. How can I Add more Files to the Package If you need to add more files to the package, you can add more <file> elements to the .nuspec file. You can also use wildcards, like **\\*.* to include all files in a folder. Tip Make sure you don't include any unnecessary files, as they will increase the size of your package. You will typically only want to include release files, and not include source files. How can I change the Icon Just replace the icon.png in the same folder as the .nuspec file. Make sure your file is really a png, and not a jpg or other format."

They can be as simple as changing the colors and fonts, or as complex as changing the layout and adding new components. Modules Modules are the functional components of your Oqtane solution. They can be as simple as a single page with some text, or as complex as a full-featured application with a database backend. Language Packs Language Packs are translations of the user interface into different languages. They can be as simple as a few words, or as complex as a full translation of the entire user interface. Pure Extensions Pure Extensions are any other type of extension that you can think of. For example, an Image-Resizer which doesn't have a UI. Prerequisites To develop on Oqtane, you will typically need the following skills / tools: Visual Studio 2022 with the latest .net 8.0 SDK SQL Server (alternatives are possible, but this is the easiest to get started) C# programming skills The following skills are also useful, or will need to be developed as you go: Blazor programming skills HTML / CSS / JavaScript / Bootstrap5 skills Git / GitHub skills Oqtane installation Basic Setup You will need to install Oqtane on your development machine to get started. For this you have 2 options: Clone/Fork the Oqtane Source Code to your local machine and run using Visual Studio This is the most common option, and the best way to also track down any issues. Install a runtime version of Oqtane in your web server This is the method you'll use when you create many Oqtane solutions, since it will run faster and allow you to focus on only the code you write.

    "keywords": "Setting Up Oqtane.Maui for Development with Visual Studio Introduction Oqtane.Maui is a hybrid .NET MAUI application that integrates with the Oqtane framework, allowing developers to create cross-platform applications with ease. This guide provides a step-by-step process to set up Oqtane.Maui for development using Visual Studio and .NET 8, specifically for Oqtane version 5.1. Prerequisites Visual Studio installed and updated on your machine. Latest .NET 8 SDK installed. A database server installed on your machine or accessible from your network. You can use MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or SQL Server. Step-by-Step Setup Guide 1. Install Oqtane Follow the official Oqtane getting started guide here. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. 2. Configure Oqtane for Hybrid .NET MAUI Open the Oqtane Admin Dashboard. Navigate to Site Settings Navigate to UI Component Settings Set the option for Hybrid? to Yes. 3. Edit the MauiConstants.cs File (Option #1) Open your Oqtane.Maui project in Visual Studio. Locate the MauiConstants.cs file in your project directory. Modify the file to point to your Oqtane web application: namespace Oqtane.Maui; public static class MauiConstants { // the API service url (used as fallback if not set in appsettings.json) public static string ApiUrl = \"\"; // public static string ApiUrl = \"http://localhost:44357/\"; // for local development (Oqtane.Server must be already running for MAUI client to connect) //public static string apiurl = \"http://localhost:44357/sitename/\"; // local microsite example //public static string apiurl = \"https://www.dnfprojects.com/\"; // for testing remote site // specify if you wish to allow users to override the url via appsettings.json in the AppDataDirectory public static bool UseAppSettings = true; } For local development you may set this as shown in the image below by commenting/uncommenting lines. 4. Modify appsettings.json (Option #2 Preferred) The preferred way to configure the URL is through the appsettings.json file. Note that the Oqtane.Maui app supports an appsettings.json file located in the FileSystem.Current.AppDataDirectory. The first time you run the Oqtane.Maui app, it will look in that location for the appsettings.json file, and if it does not exist, it will create one and display a message in the UI: This option allows you to modify the appsettings.json without having to change the MauiConstants.cs file and recompile the app (although that approach works as well). 5. Build and Deploy the Application Open the Oqtane.Maui project in Visual Studio. Build the application: Go to Build > Build Solution or press Ctrl + Shift + B. Run/launch the application: Set the Oqtane.Maui project as the startup project. Press F5 to start debugging or Ctrl + F5 to run without debugging. Alternatively, you can run the application by clicking on Windows Machine within Visual Studio. If you prefer, you can also find the application deployed on your Windows machine and run it from your desktop. Additional Tips and Troubleshooting Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed. Oqtane Framework must be running on a seperate instance of Visual Studio or a web server. For additional user functionality like file uploads you may need to create a user token. This can be accomplished by navigating to Admin Dashboard > User Management > Token Settings and setting the *Secret: option. For further assistance, refer to the Oqtane community discussion forums. Conclusion By following these steps, you should have a fully functional Oqtane.Maui setup for development with Visual Studio. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improving this guide, please contribute to the documentation."

Download and install. Note: The URL Rewrite Module is necessary for configuring URL rewriting rules in IIS, which are often used in web applications like Oqtane. Step 3: Install .NET Core Hosting Bundle Navigate to .NET Core Hosting Bundle. Download and install the bundle. Restart your machine. Note: The .NET Core Hosting Bundle is required for hosting .NET Core applications on Windows servers. Step 4: Install LocalDB If doing a local install and wanting to use LocalDB for development, navigate to LocalDB installation and choose the appropriate package. Note: LocalDB is recommended for development environments but can be substituted with other database options supported by Oqtane such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. Step 5: Install Oqtane Download the latest Install package from Oqtane Releases. Extract the files to your desired directory. Note: Extract the files to a directory where you plan to host your application. Step 6: Configure IIS App Pool Open \"Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager\" by searching for it using the search icon next to your Windows Start button. Expand the top node identifying your machine in the left-hand pane. Right-click on Application Pools and select \"Add Application Pool\". Provide a Name for the application pool, such as \"oqtane\". Specify No Managed Code for the .NET CLR version. Click OK. In the main Application Pools pane, select the newly created pool. In the right-hand Actions pane, select Advanced Settings. Scroll down to Process Model and find the Identity option. To ensure secure interaction with the file system and LocalDB without granting excessive privileges, it's recommended to modify the permissions of the folder containing the IIS Oqtane files to grant appropriate access to the Application Pool's identity. Right-click on the folder containing the Oqtane files in Windows Explorer. Select \"Properties\" and navigate to the \"Security\" tab. Click on \"Edit\" to modify permissions. Add the Application Pool's identity (e.g., IIS AppPool\\oqtane) and grant it appropriate permissions, such as Modify access. This allows the application pool to write to the directory in addition to reading from it. Locate the LocalDB Data Directory: By default, LocalDB databases are stored in the user's profile directory under C:\\Users\\{username}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Microsoft SQL Server Local DB\\Instances\\{instancename}\\. Modify Folder Permissions: Right-click on the folder containing the LocalDB database files in Windows Explorer. Select \"Properties\" and navigate to the \"Security\" tab. Click on \"Edit\" to modify permissions. Click on \"Add\" and enter the name of the user account or group that you want to grant modify permissions to. This could be your current user account or the Application Pool's identity if it needs to write to the LocalDB files. After adding the user or group, select it from the list and check the \"Modify\" permission checkbox under \"Allow\". Click \"Apply\" and then \"OK\" to save the changes. Note: For development environments, setting the App Pool's Identity to \"LocalSystem\" may be acceptable for simplicity and ease of setup. However, exercise caution and consider using a more granular approach for production environments to adhere to security best practices. Step 7: Configure IIS Website In IIS, right-click on Sites and select \"Add Website\". Provide a name and choose the Application Pool created earlier. Specify the path to the Oqtane files. Specify a Host name, e.g., \"oqtane.dev\". Note: Ensure that the host name specified here is correctly mapped to the machine in the host file. Step 8: Add a Host Entry Open Notepad as Administrator. Open the \"hosts\" file located in C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc. Add an entry mapping the host name to 127.0.0.1, e.g., \"127.0.0.1 oqtane.dev\". Save the file. Note: This step is only required for a local development environment. In shared or public environments, standard DNS configurations are used. Step 9: Navigate to Site Open your favorite browser and navigate to the specified host name, e.g., http://oqtane.dev. Follow the Oqtane install wizard, providing necessary database connection details and site administrator credentials. Click Install. Note: If encountering errors during the Install Wizard due to database creation permissions, consider creating the database manually before initiating the Install Wizard. Step 10: Secure the Site (Optional) Note It's essential to implement robust security measures for production applications before going live. Once the installation is complete and the site is up and running, consider implementing security measures to protect your Oqtane application. Enable HTTPS: Encrypt communication between the server and clients by enabling HTTPS. You can obtain SSL/TLS certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) like Let's Encrypt or purchase one from a commercial provider. Learn more about HTTPS and security best practices from the Mozilla Server Side TLS Guidelines. Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator tool helps generate secure SSL configurations for popular web servers, including Apache, Nginx, and others. It provides recommended configurations based on Mozilla's SSL/TLS best practices. Configure Authentication and Authorization: Control access to your site's resources by configuring appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms. You can leverage ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication and role-based authorization. Explore additional security topics and best practices for ASP.NET Core from the ASP.NET Core security topics documentation. Implement Security Best Practices: Follow security best practices such as input validation, output encoding, and protection against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

    "title": "Database Migrations | Oqtane Docs - APIs and more for the Modular Blazor Application Framework",
    "keywords": "Database Migrations Database migrations are essential in Oqtane to ensure that the database schema aligns with the application's version. These migrations help to safely apply changes to the database structure, such as adding new tables, modifying columns, or altering indexes, and are executed as part of the upgrade process. This guide explains how to use the migration scripts, troubleshoot common issues, and resolve database-related problems during upgrades. Overview Oqtane uses migration scripts to handle changes to the database schema between versions. When upgrading from one version to another, migration scripts are applied to bring the database up to date with the new code changes. The migration process typically involves: Running pre-defined SQL scripts that modify the database structure. Ensuring that database schema changes are consistent with the code's expectations. Handling version-specific database changes (i.e., adding, altering, or removing columns or tables). Running Database Migrations To apply migrations, follow these steps: Backup the Database: Before applying any migrations, ensure that you have a recent backup of your database to prevent data loss in case of errors. Verify the Database Version: Ensure that you are upgrading from a compatible database version. Check your current database schema version and compare it with the version you're upgrading to. Run Migration Scripts: Oqtane provides migration scripts that can be executed on your database to bring it up to date. These scripts can typically be run using the Oqtane Admin interface or manually using SQL tools like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for SQL Server or MySQL Workbench for MySQL. Check for Errors: If the migration fails, check the error messages for specific details. Look for issues such as: Missing columns or tables Foreign key constraints Compatibility issues between the database version and the schema Scripts that were not executed properly For most issues, detailed error messages will help guide you to the specific cause of the failure. Confirm Successful Migration: After the migration scripts are successfully executed, verify that the database schema matches the expected version. You may need to check specific tables or views to ensure that all changes were applied. Common Migration Issues and Solutions 1. Migration Fails Due to Missing or Incompatible Columns Symptom: The migration fails with an error message stating that certain columns or tables are missing. Solution: Verify that the migration script is correctly applied. Sometimes, manual changes to the database schema (e.g., column removals or modifications) can cause incompatibilities. Review the SQL script that was supposed to add the missing columns or tables and try to apply it manually. If a column or table was removed intentionally, ensure that your migration script accounts for these changes. 2. Error During Database Schema Comparison Symptom: There is a mismatch between the current database schema and the new version after running migration scripts. Solution: Check if the database schema was altered manually before applying migrations. If manual changes were made, you may need to reverse them to allow the migration script to apply properly. Compare the expected schema version with the current one and make necessary adjustments. Refer to the Database Schema Documentation for more details. 3. Migration Script Fails to Run on Production Database Symptom: Migration scripts run successfully in the development environment but fail in the production environment. Solution: Double-check that the correct database (development vs. production) is being used for the migration. Ensure that the production database has the necessary permissions for applying migrations. Review any environment-specific configurations that might be preventing the migration from executing properly on the production system. 4. Rollback Migration Script Symptom: The migration caused unintended changes to the database, and you need to revert to the previous version. Solution: If the migration supports rollback, use the rollback or revert command provided by Oqtane. If rollback is not supported, you will need to manually revert the database schema using backup files or reverse-engineer the changes made during the migration. Best Practices for Database Migrations Test in Development First: Always test the migration on a development or staging environment before applying it to production. This ensures that any issues with the migration scripts are caught early. Backup Your Database: Always take a full backup of the database before running any migrations. This protects your data in case something goes wrong. Review Release Notes: Check the release notes for the specific Oqtane version you're upgrading to. There may be migration-specific instructions or known issues that need to be addressed. Ensure Database Compatibility: Make sure the database server you're using is compatible with the version of Oqtane you're upgrading to. Database version upgrades may be required to fully support new schema changes. Conclusion Database migrations are an essential part of maintaining an up-to-date Oqtane application. While they help automate database updates, it is important to monitor the migration process closely for any errors and follow best practices to ensure a smooth transition. For additional information or troubleshooting, refer to the Migration Troubleshooting Guide or consult the Oqtane documentation for more details."

    "keywords": "Adding Modules to a Page In order to add a module to a page, simply open the control panel with the gear icon in the top right of a page and in the control panel module management feature there is the ability to select a new module from the options of: Admin Module: These are only available to people within the administrator role and there are many more default modules available to put onto your webpages. Common Module: These are available both to administrators and to registered users to be able to use on pages that are specified as personalizable, meaning users can modify them as they see fit and they are unique and only viewable to registered users. Developer Module: This feature is for placing a module creator onto a page which will provide you with useful pre-built structure and methods for writing code for your own modules. There are also features after selecting the module that you would like which are the: Title: Which is what will be displayed directly above the module as its title, if nothing is selected then the module's name will be put as the title. Pane: Select which content pane you want the module to go inside of. Panes are made visible with the content editor. Container: Select if you would like to have a title displayed above the module or not have one. Adding One Module Across Multiple Pages As noted earlier, modules are reusable pieces of functionality, and as such a single module can be inserted across multiple pages in a site. Say, for example, you have an HTML module that holds a banner image and you want that banner image to also exist on five specific pages in your site. Instead of adding a new module to all five of those pages and then inserting the same image, you can simply go into the Control Panel and then click Add an Existing Module to the page. Adding already existing modules or sharing modules across multiple pages makes managing content that's repeated much more efficient. A content manager can then make edits in one module and instantly have those edits reflected across every page on which the module is shared. When a user hovers over the Modules menu item just below the Add New Module option is the Add Existing Module option. This is the option you select when you want to add a module that already exists in the site to a different page. When opting to use Add Existing Module, you must first select the page to copy a module from, which will populate the drop-down list of modules. You can then follow the same process of adding a module to the page."

Whether you're adding new functionality, configuring existing modules, or troubleshooting issues, this section provides comprehensive resources to assist you. What is a Module? A module is a reusable, plug-and-play piece of functionality. It's a way to extend the functionality of the framework with whatever functionality you desire. Examples of modules could be photo galleries, blogs, rotators, forms, and so on. There can be multiple modules on a page and even multiple instances of the same module on a page. It's very common to see multiple HTML modules on a single page. When you install Oqtane, the platform ships with a base set of modules already installed in the system. There are too many that come with the solution out of the box to list here, but suffice it to say that all modules needed for basic functionality within a website come with the solution. More modules can also be downloaded for use or modules that you can created can be uploaded. Modules on Pages Modules are placed onto pages in locations called “panes”. These panes are defined by the theme's designer. These themes dictates the overall look and feel of your site and is usually created by a front-end designer. Panes can span the full width of the page or be positioned in a column fashion. It may be helpful to think of panes as windows in the design of the site where you can drop in modules. You can move modules around the panes by using the content editor. This is an example of a content pane.

To get into the editor, simply click over the pencil icon top-right corner of the page. This puts you into the edit mode where you will see small white arrows in the top-right corner of every module on the page. These small arrows at the top left corners of each module allow you to move the module on the page, access the module's settings, edit the module, delete the module, and access any specific functionality related to the module. Once in Edit mode you will notice that Oqtane uses a very user-friendly and intuitive approach to managing content. Whenever you want to edit content in Oqtane, you go to the location where the content resides and edit it right there in place. Moving Modules Once a module is on the page, you can move its location again if needed. All that is needed is to enter the content editor by clicking on the pencil icon in the top right hand side with editing permission on a certain page. And then selecting the small downward pointing arrow in the top left of the module to do a variety of things to it, including: Move to Top: Moves the modules to the top of the page to be the first module displayed. Move Up: Moves the module up to be above the module above it. Move Down: Move the module down below the module beneath it. Move to Bottom: Moves the module to the bottom of the page, below all other modules. If the page has the layout for multiple panes, which will allows for three center rows and a top and bottom row that can have content inserted into them, then there will be additional options available which are: Move to Top Pane: Moves the module to the content pane at the top of the page. Move to Left Pane: Moves the module to the left-most column. Move to Right Pane: Moves the module to the right-most column. Move to Content Pane: Moves the module to the central column.

Start the Generator In your Oqtane site, go to /admin/themes to see the Themes management: Click on \"Create Theme\" and fill in the wizard as follows: Owner Name should be your company name or similar. It will be used in the Namespace of the generated code. Theme Name will be the technical name of the theme. It too will be used in the Namespace of your generated code. Template is meant to select from various templates, but as of now there is only one. Framework Reference is to decide what Oqtane (not .net Framework) your Theme will target, but as of now you can always only select the current framework running on your Oqtane. Location is where the generated code will be placed. It is best practice to put this side-by side to your Oqtane solution. Once you click on Create Theme you will see: Continue in Visual Studio The generator created this folder with a visual studio solution beside your Oqtane Framework folder: Next, open the solution file in that folder: You will now see 3 solutions according to best-practices: Build/Rebuild the Package Solution Build the Package solution to compile and copy the files to the Oqtane installation.

What is a Theme? A theme is a collection of files that define the look and feel of your website. Themes can include CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets that are used to style your website. Since Oqtane is based on .net and Blazor, themes are built using Blazor components and these are compiled into a DLL that is loaded by the Oqtane framework. Here's an example: In this example, the theme controls: Placement, size and styling of the logo - as well as how it changes in responsive scenarios. The layout of the main menu, including the dropdowns. The layout of the footer, including the social media links. Font sizes and colors for various headings and normal text.

In the code you can see it contains The namespace of the theme - must be unique, and must match the theme/container namespace the Name of the theme - displayed to the user the Version of the theme the PackageName - used for installation / differentiation the optional ThemeSettingsType (class name) of the theme settings the optional ContainerSettingsType (class name) of the container settings a list of Resources - CSS and JS files that are loaded when the theme is used note: the Resources can also be specified in each Theme.razor file using System.Collections.Generic; using Oqtane.Models; using Oqtane.Themes; using Oqtane.Shared; namespace Oqtane.Theme.Arsha { public class ThemeInfo : ITheme { public Models.Theme Theme => new Models.Theme { Name = \"Arsha\", Version = \"1.0.0\", PackageName = \"Oqtane.Theme.Arsha\", ThemeSettingsType = \"Oqtane.Theme.Arsha.ThemeSettings, Oqtane.Theme.Arsha.Client.Oqtane\", ContainerSettingsType = \"Oqtane.Theme.Arsha.ContainerSettings, Oqtane.Theme.Arsha.Client.Oqtane\", Resources = new List<Resource>() { // Google Fonts new Resource { ResourceType = ResourceType.Stylesheet, Url = \"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300,300i,400,400i,600,600i,700,700i%7CRaleway:300,300i,400,400i,500,500i,600,600i,700,700i%7CPoppins:300,300i,400,400i,500,500i,600,600i,700,700i\" }, // Vendor CSS Files new Resource { ResourceType = ResourceType.Stylesheet, Url = \"~/assets/vendor/aos/aos.css\" }, // ...rest of files omitted for brevity // Template Main CSS File new Resource { ResourceType = ResourceType.Stylesheet, Url = \"~/assets/css/style.css\" }, // Vendor JS Files new Resource { ResourceType = ResourceType.Script, Url = \"~/assets/vendor/aos/aos.js\", Location = ResourceLocation.Body }, // ...rest of files omitted for brevity // Template Main JS File new Resource { ResourceType = ResourceType.Script, Url = \"~/assets/js/main.js\", Location = ResourceLocation.Body, Reload = true, RenderMode = RenderModes.Static }, new Resource { ResourceType = ResourceType.Script, Url = \"~/assets/js/interop.js\", Location = ResourceLocation.Body, RenderMode = RenderModes.Interactive } } }; } } The Theme File The Theme.razor file is the main file that is shown to the user. It contains the HTML structure of the theme and can include other Blazor components. Important things to know: The @namespace directive must match the namespace of the theme The @inherits directive must inherit from ThemeBase or a class that inherits from ThemeBase The @inject directive can be used to inject services like NavigationManager or ISettingService The @code block can contain C# code that is executed when the component is rendered The HTML part - which is the HTML inside the <body> tag (without <head> etc.). This \"html\" can be normal HTML such as div, section, h1, p, img etc. Razor variables such as @PageState.Page.Name Razor data from functions such as @NavigateUrl() Razor statements such as @if or @foreach Blazor components such as <NavMenu /> or <Login /> @namespace Oqtane.Theme.Arsha @inherits ThemeBase @inject NavigationManager NavigationManager @inject ISettingService SettingService <!-- ======= Header ======= --> <header id=\"header\" class=\"@_headerclass\"> <div class=\"container d-flex align-items-center\"> <!-- omited for brevity --> <nav id=\"navbar\" class=\"navbar\"> <NavMenu /> </nav> <div class=\"mx-3 controls-group\"><UserProfile /> <Login /> <ControlPanel /></div> </div> </header> <!-- End Header --> @if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_hero)) { <!-- ======= Hero Section ======= --> @((MarkupString)_hero) <!-- End Hero --> <!-- ======= Main ======= --> <main id=\"main\"> <Pane Name=\"@PaneNames.Default\" /> </main> <!-- End #main --> } else { <!-- ======= Main ======= --> <main id=\"main\"> <!-- ======= Breadcrumbs ======= --> <section class=\"breadcrumbs\"> <div class=\"container\"> <h2 class=\"mt-2\">@PageState.Page.Name</h2> </div> </section><!-- End Breadcrumbs --> <section class=\"inner-page\"> <div class=\"container\"> <Pane Name=\"@PaneNames.Default\" /> </div> </section> </main> <!-- End Main --> } <!-- ======= Footer ======= --> @((MarkupString)_footer) <!-- End Footer --> <a href=\"@NavigateUrl()\" class=\"back-to-top d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center\" data-enhance-nav=\"false\"><i class=\"bi bi-arrow-up-short\"></i></a> @code { public override string Name => \"Default\"; public override string Panes => PaneNames.Default; private string _hero = \"\"; private string _headerclass = \"\"; private string _footer = \"\"; protected override async Task OnParametersSetAsync() { // omitted for brevity } protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender) { // omitted for brevity } private string DefaultFooter { get { return \"<footer id=\\\"footer\\\">\\n\" + \" <div class=\\\"footer-newsletter\\\">\\n\" + <!-- omitted for brevity --> \" </div>\\n\" + \"</footer>\\n\"; } } } The Container File The Container.razor file is the main wrapper around a module. Here's what you should know: The @namespace directive must match the namespace of the theme The @inherits directive must inherit from ContainerBase or a class that inherits from ContainerBase The @inject directive can be used to inject services like ISettingService The @code block can contain C# code that is executed when the component is rendered The HTML parts with the same possibilities as the theme above. @namespace Oqtane.Theme.Arsha @inherits ContainerBase @inject ISettingService SettingService @if (_title) { @if (_animate) { <section> <div class=\"container\" data-aos=\"fade-up\"> <ModuleActions /> @if (ModuleState.Title != \"-\") { <div class=\"section-title\"> <h2>@ModuleState.Title</h2> </div> } <div class=\"row\"> <ModuleInstance /> </div> </div> </section> } else { <!-- omitted for brevity --> } } else { <!-- omitted for brevity --> } @code { private bool _title = true; private bool _animate = false; protected override void OnParametersSet() { // omitted for brevity } } Blazor Components In addition to the required minimum files, you can also include other Blazor components. Here's an example of the NavMenu.razor. It doesn't do much, but check if the menu should show, and then calls the NavMenuItems component. @namespace Oqtane.Theme.Arsha @inherits MenuBase @if (MenuPages.Any()) { <NavMenuItems ParentPage=\"null\" Pages=\"MenuPages\" /> <i class=\"bi bi-list mobile-nav-toggle\"></i> } The NavMenuItems.razor is way more complex, as it recursively calls itself to render the menu items. @namespace Oqtane.Theme.Arsha @inherits MenuItemsBase <ul> @foreach (var childPage in GetChildPages()) { var _attributes = new Dictionary<string, object>(); _attributes.Add(\"href\", GetUrl(childPage)); var _target = GetTarget(childPage); if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_target)) _attributes.Add(\"target\", _target); if (!childPage.HasChildren) { <!-- omitted for brevity --> } else { <li class=\"dropdown\"> <a @attributes=\"_attributes\"><span>@childPage.Name</span> @if (childPage.Level == 0) <i class=\"bi bi-chevron-down\"></i> else <i class=\"bi bi-chevron-right\"></i> </a> <NavMenuItems ParentPage=\"childPage\" Pages=\"Pages\" /> </li> } } </ul>"

  "guides/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-developing-modules.html": {
    "href": "guides/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-developing-modules.html",
    "title": "Troubleshooting Developing Modules | Oqtane Docs - APIs and more for the Modular Blazor Application Framework",
    "keywords": "Troubleshooting Developing Modules Overview This guide offers troubleshooting steps for common issues encountered when developing, modifying, or debugging modules in the Oqtane Framework. Modules are key components that enable the functionality of your site, and problems with modules can impact the user experience and site performance. The troubleshooting steps outlined below address the most common challenges faced by module developers. 1. Module Not Loading Symptoms: The module does not appear on the page, or it loads as a blank space. Solution: Check Module Registration: Ensure that your module is correctly registered in the Oqtane system. Verify that the module is listed in the admin dashboard under the module management section. Inspect Controller: If your module has a controller, ensure it is correctly implemented and the routes are set up properly. Missing or incorrect routes can prevent the module from loading. Review Logs: Check the application logs for errors related to module loading or initialization. Look for errors in the Oqtane logs that might provide hints about why the module isn't loading. Module Permissions: Make sure the user has the necessary permissions to view the module. Modules may be hidden if the current user role lacks the required permissions. 2. Module Layout Not Displaying Correctly Symptoms: The module displays but its layout is incorrect, or it appears with broken elements. Solution: Check Layout Files: Review the .cshtml or .razor layout files for the module. Ensure they are correctly structured, with proper references to CSS, JavaScript, and component elements. Check Styles and Scripts: Verify that the module’s required stylesheets and scripts are included and properly referenced. Missing or incorrect references may result in layout issues. Responsive Design: Ensure that the module is responsive, especially if it uses a grid layout. Verify that CSS media queries are in place to adapt the module's layout for different screen sizes. 3. JavaScript Not Working in the Module Symptoms: JavaScript functionality (such as interactivity) doesn't work or fails to trigger in the module. Solution: Inspect Browser Console: Open the browser’s developer console and check for JavaScript errors. Missing files, syntax errors, or issues with dependencies could prevent the script from running. Check Script References: Make sure JavaScript files are correctly linked in the module’s layout file. Verify that the JavaScript files are loaded in the right order, as some modules may require specific libraries (e.g., jQuery or Bootstrap). Check for jQuery Conflicts: If using jQuery, ensure no conflicts with other JavaScript libraries. For instance, ensure jQuery is loaded before any jQuery-dependent scripts. Debug JavaScript Code: Use debugging tools to step through the JavaScript code and confirm if all functions are being executed as expected. 4. Module Not Updating Changes Symptoms: Changes made to the module's source code are not reflected when the page is refreshed. Solution: Clear Browser Cache: Sometimes, changes may not appear due to cached files. Clear the browser cache and refresh the page. Clear Oqtane Cache: In Oqtane, cached components and modules might delay updates. Clear Oqtane's internal cache from the control panel to ensure the latest changes are applied. Rebuild the Module: If the module is being built from source, ensure that the build process has completed successfully. Rebuild the module to confirm that the compiled version is up to date. 5. Module Throws Errors or Exceptions Symptoms: The module fails to load, and exceptions or errors are thrown during its operation. Solution: Check Logs for Exceptions: Review the server logs for exceptions that are being thrown. The logs can provide detailed information about the specific error and the module’s behavior at runtime. Verify Database Connections: If your module interacts with a database, ensure that database connections are correctly configured. Incorrect connection strings or missing database tables can cause runtime errors. Check for Missing Dependencies: Ensure all dependencies required by the module are properly included. Missing DLLs or dependencies can cause the module to fail. Debug in Development Mode: Enable detailed error messages in the development environment to get a more granular view of the issues and track down the root cause. 6. Module Not Performing as Expected Symptoms: The module functions incorrectly, or some features do not work as intended. Solution: Check Business Logic: Review the module’s business logic to ensure it performs the intended actions. Validate that all the necessary conditions are being met within the code. Test Module Inputs: Verify that the inputs (e.g., user input or data from the database) are being processed correctly by the module. Check Configuration Settings: Ensure the module’s settings and configuration are correct. Misconfigured settings can lead to unexpected behavior. Use Debugging: If needed, debug the module step-by-step to observe the internal state and pinpoint where the behavior diverges from expectations. 7. Module Permissions Not Working Symptoms: The module is not visible or accessible based on the user’s permissions. Solution: Verify Permission Settings: Check the permissions set for the module in the Oqtane control panel. Ensure that the user role has the correct permissions for viewing or interacting with the module. Check Role Assignment: Make sure the user’s role is properly assigned and that the permissions for the module are aligned with the role’s capabilities. Review Module Visibility Logic: Some modules may have additional logic in place that controls visibility based on user roles. Verify that the logic is functioning as intended. 8. Module Dependencies Not Working Symptoms: The module relies on other modules, but the dependent modules are not functioning correctly, leading to errors or missing features. Solution: Check Module Dependencies: Verify that all the required dependencies for the module are correctly installed and activated. Some modules may rely on other modules or services, and those dependencies need to be configured correctly. Review Documentation: Review the documentation of the dependent modules to ensure compatibility. Sometimes, module dependencies may require specific versions or configurations. Ensure Dependency Registration: Ensure that any required modules are registered in the Oqtane system and correctly linked to your module. 9. Module Compatibility with Oqtane Updates Symptoms: After updating Oqtane, the module behaves incorrectly or fails to load. Solution: Review Release Notes: Check the Oqtane release notes for any breaking changes or updates to the module system that may affect your module. Pay attention to any updates in the API or core framework that may impact your module’s functionality. Update Module Code: If necessary, modify your module to ensure compatibility with the latest version of Oqtane. This could involve changing APIs, adjusting for new features, or removing deprecated functionality. Test in Development: Test the updated module in a development environment before deploying it to production to ensure it behaves as expected with the latest Oqtane version. Conclusion By following these troubleshooting steps, developers should be able to resolve the majority of common issues encountered when developing modules for the Oqtane Framework. If issues persist, further assistance may be required from the Oqtane community or support channels."

    "title": "Troubleshooting Developing Themes | Oqtane Docs - APIs and more for the Modular Blazor Application Framework",
    "keywords": "Troubleshooting Developing Themes Overview This guide provides troubleshooting steps for common issues developers may encounter when creating, modifying, or debugging themes in the Oqtane Framework. Themes control the look and feel of the site, and issues related to theme development can affect the user experience and functionality. The troubleshooting steps below address some of the most common problems faced by theme developers. 1. Theme Not Displaying Correctly Symptoms: After activating the theme, the site displays with default styles or fails to load the theme correctly. Solution: Check Theme Files: Ensure that the theme files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) are correctly located in the theme directory and are properly referenced in the theme's .cshtml files. Any missing or misreferenced files can cause the theme to load incorrectly. Clear Cache: Sometimes, changes may not appear due to cached assets. Clear both the browser cache and the Oqtane cache by going to the control panel and refreshing the page. Validate Theme Settings: Ensure the correct theme is set in the Oqtane control panel. If a different theme is activated, it may override your changes. Check for Errors: Review the browser console and server logs for any errors that might indicate missing files or issues with theme-related scripts or styles. 2. Theme Styles Not Applied Symptoms: The theme loads but the styles do not apply as expected. Solution: Check CSS References: Verify that the CSS files are correctly linked in the layout files (e.g., _Host.cshtml). Ensure the paths to the CSS files are correct, and check that they are being loaded in the page's <head> section. Validate CSS Rules: Ensure there are no conflicting or overridden styles. Use browser developer tools to inspect the page and check whether the CSS rules are being applied to elements as intended. Check for Specificity Issues: If your styles are not being applied, it could be due to CSS specificity. Review the order of CSS rules and make sure that your custom styles are more specific than the default styles or are being loaded after them. 3. JavaScript Not Working Symptoms: JavaScript functionality (e.g., interactive elements) does not work after applying the theme. Solution: Check Console for Errors: Open the browser’s developer console and look for any JavaScript errors. These could provide clues about why the script isn't running, such as missing files or syntax issues. Check Script References: Ensure JavaScript files are correctly linked in the layout (_Host.cshtml). Verify that they are loaded in the right order, as some libraries may depend on others (e.g., jQuery needs to be loaded before Bootstrap). Check for jQuery Conflicts: If you're using jQuery, ensure there are no conflicts with other JavaScript libraries. For example, a newer version of jQuery might conflict with older plugins or vice versa. 4. Theme Layout Issues Symptoms: The theme layout breaks on different screen sizes, or the content does not appear as expected. Solution: Responsive Design: Ensure that your theme's CSS includes responsive design rules (e.g., media queries). This ensures that the layout adapts to different screen sizes and devices. Check Layout Files: Review your theme’s layout files (e.g., _Layout.cshtml) for issues with the grid system, container elements, or view sections that could be causing layout issues. Browser Compatibility: Test your theme in different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility. Some CSS or JavaScript features may not be supported in older versions of certain browsers. Use Browser Developer Tools: Use developer tools in the browser to test different screen sizes and identify issues with the layout or design. 5. Theme Assets Not Loading Symptoms: Images, fonts, or other assets are missing or not loading after activating the theme. Solution: Check File Paths: Ensure that the paths to images, fonts, and other assets are correct. If you're using relative paths, verify they are correct based on the folder structure. Permissions: Check that the server has the proper permissions to serve static assets (e.g., images, fonts, JS files). Browser Console Errors: Review the browser console for errors related to missing assets. These errors can provide the exact paths that are broken, allowing you to correct them. Check for CORS Issues: If your theme uses assets hosted on a different domain (e.g., CDNs), ensure that cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is configured correctly on the server. 6.

For instance, the default Oqtane theme includes not only standard rows and columns but also numerous additional panes, which allow for a wide range of layout possibilities. While simpler themes may only display a few basic options, the default theme might provide over 20 panes, including: Full-Width Panes: These panes span the entire width of the page. Examples include: Top Full Width Pane: A full-width pane at the top of the page. Bottom Full Width Pane: A full-width pane at the bottom of the page. 100% Width Panes: These also span the full width, but are distinct from other full-width panes in terms of placement: Top 100% Pane: Positioned below the top full-width pane, occupying the full page width. Bottom 100% Pane: Positioned above the bottom full-width pane, also spanning the entire page width. 50%/50% Split Panes: Divide the page into two equal sections: Left 50% Pane and Right 50% Pane. 33%/33%/33% Split Panes: For a balanced three-column layout: Left 33% Pane, Center 33% Pane, and Right 33% Pane. 25%/25%/25%/25% Split Panes: For a four-column layout: Left Outer 25% Pane, Left Inner 25% Pane, Right Inner 25% Pane, and Right Outer 25% Pane. Asymmetrical Ratios: Options like: Left 66% Pane and Right 33% Pane. Left 33% Pane and Right 66% Pane. Footer Pane: An additional pane often reserved for footer content. These pane options let administrators place modules precisely within the layout structure, which is divided into sections adding up to 100% of the layout width. The image shows this range of options, giving a visual reference of the Move To > menu options when working with themes that support complex layouts.

    "title": "SQL Management | Oqtane Docs - APIs and more for the Modular Blazor Application Framework",
    "keywords": "SQL Management Overview The SQL Management feature provides direct access to the database through the Oqtane interface, allowing administrators to execute SQL queries on the tenant databases (also called sites). This feature enables quick database management and troubleshooting without requiring a separate SQL Server Management Studio instance. By using the SQL console, you can run SQL queries directly from the Oqtane application. The results of any executed SQL statements will be displayed below the execute button, providing immediate feedback. This feature is particularly useful for administrators who need to interact with the database quickly. Accessing the SQL Management Feature Open the Control Panel: Click the Control Panel icon to access additional settings. Navigate to Admin Dashboard: In the Control Panel, select the button to open the Admin Dashboard. Open SQL Management: In the Admin Dashboard, click on the SQL Management icon to access the SQL console. Adding a Connection To add a new database connection: Click the Add Connection button in the SQL Management interface. The Add Connection Settings window will appear, where you can configure the connection settings such as the server name, credentials, and database name. Default Connection Once you've set up your connection, the default connection will be displayed for easy reference. Executing Queries After setting up the connection, you can begin writing your SQL queries. To execute a query, click the Execute button. Using the SQL Management Console Once inside the SQL Management page, you can interact with the SQL console to execute queries on the tenant databases. SQL Console Interface Query Input Field: This is where you type your SQL query. Execute Button: After entering your SQL statement, click the Execute button to run the query on the selected tenant database. Results Display: The results of the executed query will be displayed directly below the Execute button, showing either the returned data or any error messages. SQL Query Example SELECT * FROM Users WHERE IsActive = 1; This example SQL query will return all active users from the Users table. Error Handling If there is an issue with your SQL query, an error message will be shown in the results section, providing helpful feedback to correct the query. Common issues could include: Syntax errors: Ensure your SQL syntax is correct. Incorrect table or column names: Double-check your database schema to ensure the table and column names match. Access permissions issues: Verify that your user account has sufficient privileges to execute SQL queries on the selected tenant database. Warning: Running SQL queries directly on the database can modify data and schema. It is advised to back up your database before making significant changes. Best Practices Avoid Deleting Data: Be cautious when running DELETE statements or performing operations that alter the database schema. Always double-check the WHERE clause before executing a DELETE query. Test Queries: Test queries in a development or staging environment before running them on a production database to prevent unintended consequences. Backup: Always ensure that you have a recent backup of your database before executing potentially destructive queries, such as DELETE or UPDATE operations that affect large sets of data. Common SQL Queries Retrieving All Records SELECT * FROM [TableName]; Retrieving All Records SELECT * FROM [TableName]; This query retrieves all records from the specified table. It is useful for getting an overview of the data in any table. Updating Records UPDATE [TableName] SET [ColumnName] = 'NewValue' WHERE [Condition]; This query updates existing records in the specified table based on the given condition. Use this to modify data for specific records in a table. Deleting Records DELETE FROM [TableName] WHERE [Condition]; Deleting Records Be cautious when using the DELETE statement, as it permanently removes records from the database. Make sure your WHERE clause is accurate before executing the query. Troubleshooting Query Doesn't Execute: If your query doesn't run, verify that the syntax is correct. Ensure that you are connected to the right tenant database. No Results Displayed: If your query returns no data, check the conditions in your SQL query, or verify that the data exists in the database. Ensure the table and columns are properly named and populated. Permissions Issues: If you encounter permission-related errors, verify that your user account has the appropriate access rights for executing SQL queries. Conclusion The SQL Management console is a powerful tool for managing your tenant databases directly from within Oqtane. While it simplifies database interactions for administrators, it should be used with caution, especially when modifying or deleting data. Always double-check your queries and test them in a safe environment to avoid unintentional changes to your databases."

The process is different depending on if you are running Oqtane from Visual Studio (while developing) or if you are running in production (typically in IIS). Restart Oqtane in Production Go to /admin/system and hit Restart... ...confirm your choice... ...and wait for it to restart.

So you can use the steps above to stop Oqtane, but this makes more sense: Stop Oqtane in Visual Studio: ...then start it again: Manually Force-Restart Oqtane In special scenarios - e.g. in production when Oqtane crashes, you may want to force-restart Oqtane. The simplest method to do this is to open the web.config and save it again. This will restart Oqtane."
