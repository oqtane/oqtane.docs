# Oqtane Docs Builder

This project generates the documentation for [Oqtane Framework](https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework) using [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/).

It's explained in detail on https://docs.oqtane.org/articles/documentation/

## Setup

To set everything up, do the following:

In some folder (like `c:\projects\oqtane`) pull this repo and also the `oqtane.framework`. You should then have something like

* some-root\oqtane.docs
* some-root\oqtane.framework

## Run with Visual Studio

Open the `Oqtane Docs Builder.sln` solution in this folder and just rebuild everything. 

The final docs are generated into the `/docs` folder.

## Test locally

As some of the stuff needs JavaScript which only runs well from HTTP, you should setup IIS to publish the `/docs` folder on any domain you want - like `docs.oqtane.me`. 


## Publish

When you push back this repo GitHub will automatically publish the updated documentation.
